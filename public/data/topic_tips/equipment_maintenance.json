  "key_insights": [
    "Replacement schedules matter: Aerobika annually, nebulizer tubing monthly, LifeStraw membrane 6-12 months depending on use, compressors when performance degrades (louder noise, slower nebulization)",
    "Dawn detergent specifically validated by Dr. Falkinham's lab research to release adherent NTM from equipment surfaces (doesn't kill, but releases so NTM can be washed away with spring water rinse)",
    "Weekly batch sterilization protocol (wash daily with Dawn, sterilize all equipment once weekly) reduces burnout while maintaining safety per Berkeley NTM conference experts",
    "Compressor failure signs: progressive slowing of nebulization time, increased noise after 1+ years - typically not fixable, replacement needed",
    "Mesh nebulizers prone to mineral/scale buildup stopping function - vinegar soaks restore performance, prevented by regular cleaning with vinegar + boiled distilled water",
    "Water remaining in equipment after sterilization is sterile and not a concern per Dr. Falkinham - shake out excess but don't stress about complete drying",
    "Medicare DME rental system often abused with monthly rental fees exceeding purchase price - patients may benefit from buying preferred compressor models outright"

  "common_questions": [
    {
      "question": "How often should I replace my Aerobika?",
      "answer": "Replace annually per manufacturer instructions (page 6 of Aerobika PDF insert). After one year, internal mechanism can wear out causing increased resistance during inhalation. Replace sooner if visibly damaged. Most patients follow the 1-year replacement schedule."
    },
    {
      "question": "When do I need a new nebulizer compressor?",
      "answer": "Replace when performance degrades: nebulization time progressively increases (15 min → 35+ min over weeks/months) or compressor gets much louder after 1+ years. These indicate internal component wear/failure not fixable by changing tubing or filters. Check warranty first - some brands replace free under 1-year warranty. Medicare covers every 5 years."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I replace nebulizer tubing?",
      "answer": "Monthly per National Jewish Health recommendation. Watch for moisture forming inside tube (hold to light after use to check). If small moisture, run compressor alone 2-3 minutes to dry tube. If too much moisture, change immediately. Insurance covers every 6 months, but NJH says monthly best practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to sterilize nebulizer equipment every single day?",
      "answer": "No - washing daily with Dawn detergent + spring water rinse, then sterilizing complete batch once weekly is sufficient per NTM Berkeley conference experts. Buy 7 days' worth of equipment, wash each set after use, air dry on paper towels in open, then sterilize all sets together weekly (15-min steam + 45-min dry cycle). Reduces daily burden."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Dawn dish soap specifically recommended?",
      "answer": "Dr. Falkinham's lab research proved Dawn releases adherent NTM from equipment surfaces. NTM cells are hydrophobic and stick to all surfaces - Dawn breaks that attachment. Important: Dawn doesn't KILL NTM, it RELEASES it so you can wash it away with spring water rinse. Other detergents may work but haven't been tested."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it safe if water droplets remain in my equipment after washing?",
      "answer": "Yes if equipment was sterilized - per Dr. Falkinham, 'the remaining moisture is sterile, there is no problem.' Shake out excess water before drying. Aerobika cartridge and AeroEclipse twirly part hold water naturally. Baby bottle sterilizer with 45-min dry cycle helps achieve complete drying if you prefer, but residual sterile water not dangerous."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often do I change LifeStraw pitcher filters?",
      "answer": "Membrane filter: every 12 months (standard use ~2.5L daily) or 6 months if using 2 pitchers daily (5L). Carbon filter (optional for taste): every 2 months standard use, or monthly for heavy use. Many patients skip carbon filter since it's not needed for NTM removal and can harbor bacteria if not changed on schedule."
    },
    {
      "question": "My mesh nebulizer stopped working - how do I fix it?",
      "answer": "Usually mineral/scale buildup on fine mesh screen. Soak reservoir in white vinegar for several hours to dissolve minerals. Or use mix of vinegar + dish soap + boiled distilled water, soak, then sterilize. Prevention: clean after every use with vinegar solution to prevent scale buildup. Phillips Go discontinued; Naweti Portable Rechargeable (Amazon) and Omron recommended replacements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What baby bottle sterilizer brands work for nebulizer equipment?",
      "answer": "Dr. Jennifer Honda (microbiologist) tested Philips Avent, Baby Brezza, Grownsy, and Bololo - all work effectively. Sterilization cycle 15 minutes, drying cycle 45 minutes. Philips Avent slimmer/more compact than Bololo. Once lid opened, equipment no longer sterile. Bololo replacement filters from manufacturer website (bololo.com) via PayPal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I buy multiple sets of nebulizer equipment?",
      "answer": "Yes - buying 7 days' worth (14 sets for 2x daily use) allows batch sterilization once weekly instead of daily. Wash each set with Dawn after use, air dry on paper towels (open air, not closed bin), store in sealed plastic until weekly sterilization. Greatly reduces daily sterilization burden while maintaining safety per expert recommendations."
