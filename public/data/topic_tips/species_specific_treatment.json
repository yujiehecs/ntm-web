  "common_questions": [
    {
      "question": "How is M. abscessus treatment different from MAC treatment?",
      "answer": "M. abscessus requires much more aggressive treatment: 4-8 weeks intensive IV antibiotics as hospital inpatient (amikacin + cefoxitin/imipenem), followed by 12-18 months oral/nebulized antibiotics (clofazimine, azithromycin, nebulized amikacin). MAC typically requires oral antibiotics only (Big 3). Abscessus cure rate only 40-60% vs MAC 80-90%. Side effects much more severe including hearing loss."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is M. abscessus ERM41 and why is it worse?",
      "answer": "ERM41 is a subspecies of M. abscessus that carries a gene making it highly resistant to macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin/clarithromycin). It often has resistance to multiple drug classes, leaving only 3-4 susceptible antibiotics. Requires specialist care at centers like NJH. Treatment takes 14-18 months with high toxicity and lower cure rates than other abscessus strains."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I start M. abscessus treatment immediately even if I feel fine?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. NJH protocol: watchful waiting if colony count <50, no symptoms, and stable CT scans. Some patients successfully delay treatment for years with aggressive twice-daily airway clearance. Treatment decision based on: colony counts (trends over time), CT scan progression, symptoms (fever, weight loss, declining lung function), age and comorbidities. Some patients clear abscessus with airway clearance alone."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can M. abscessus be cured?",
      "answer": "Yes, but cure rates only 40-60% with intensive treatment. After 12 months culture negativity, 50% recur. However, 50-75% of recurrences are reinfections (new infections from environment) not relapse. Long-term success stories exist: 13+ years disease-free with surgery + antibiotics + continued airway clearance and prevention measures."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is M. chimaera treated?",
      "answer": "Standard Big 3 protocol (azithromycin, ethambutol, rifampin/rifabutin) for 18+ months. May require adding Arikayce if not responding. Major side effect is persistent fatigue throughout treatment. Continue antibiotics 12 months after culture conversion. Success rates similar to MAC (80-90%)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I have both M. abscessus and another species (MAC or chimaera)?",
      "answer": "Mixed infections extremely difficult to treat simultaneously - antibiotics for one species may not work for the other. Doctors may recommend: watchful waiting if both low colony counts, treating dominant species first, or sequential treatment. UK doctors report it's very challenging to isolate and treat both at once."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are rare species like M. fortuitum, M. xenopi, M. simiae treated?",
      "answer": "M. fortuitum: easiest to treat - oral doxycycline + levofloxacin 8 months, no IV needed, generally well-tolerated. M. xenopi: azithromycin + ethambutol + moxifloxacin but poor response rates, severe side effects. M. simiae: resistant to standard MAC drugs, very limited treatment data. M. arupense: almost no published data. All rare species require specialist consultation at NJH or similar center."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do my M. abscessus colony counts fluctuate so much?",
      "answer": "Normal variation - sputum samples aren't perfect representations of lung bacteria. Counts influenced by: quality of sample, recent airway clearance effectiveness, environmental exposures, immune system fluctuations. NJH doctors look for trends over multiple samples, not single results. Single high count can be 'anomaly' if subsequent tests return to baseline. Colony count <50 generally considered low burden."
