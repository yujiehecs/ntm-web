    {
      "question": "Can I work full-time while on Big 3 treatment for MAC?",
      "answer": "Yes, it's possible but very challenging. Many patients successfully work full-time during treatment, but it requires significant sacrifices and careful time management. Remote work makes it much more feasible. Expect the first 2 months to be hardest during medication adjustment (possible 'fog,' fatigue, GI issues). Take medications at night with dinner to sleep through worst side effects. Gradually introduce meds over 3 weeks rather than all at once. Have Zofran prescription for nausea emergencies. Schedule airway clearance before work (5:30-6am) and late afternoon/evening (4-5pm or 9pm). Consider that weekends become only time for rest and socializing. Some patients find vest therapy helps because it doesn't require focused attention. Reality: 50%+ eventually reduce hours or leave work because managing disease is effectively full-time job."
    },
    {
      "question": "What accommodations should I request from my employer for BE/NTM?",
      "answer": "Most valuable: remote work from home (full-time or hybrid 2-3 days/week). Eliminates commute time for airway clearance, allows flexibility for nebbing/rest during day, removes exposure to sick coworkers. Also request: flexible hours for medical appointments (monthly or more frequent), separate sick leave beyond standard PTO (12 days insufficient with treatment side effects and exacerbations), ability to work from home on bad fatigue days. Have physician write accommodation letter describing 'serious chronic lung condition requiring daily treatments and frequent medical monitoring' without excessive medical detail. For companies with 15+ employees, this is ADA-protected. For smaller companies (under 15 employees), no legal obligation - approach as collaborative problem-solving before accepting job rather than after hiring. Consider intermittent FMLA leave as backup for bad days."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I manage the time demands of airway clearance while working full-time?",
      "answer": "Reality check: airway clearance takes 1 hour twice daily, plus 30-60 minutes daily cleaning/sterilizing equipment, plus medical appointments, plus the disease itself. Strategies that help: 1) Remote work saves 1-3 hours commute time daily. 2) Do first session immediately on waking (5:30-6am) before work, second at 4-5pm before dinner or 9pm after dinner (2-3 hours after eating). 3) Use commute time for Aerobika/flutter valve in car. 4) Get vest therapy so you can work at computer while doing clearance. 5) Outsource housework (laundry service, house cleaning, meal shortcuts). 6) One employer lets employee do evening session during last 30 minutes of work day when no speaking calls. 7) Some use virtual exercise classes at home to save gym travel time. 8) Join Under-50/Still Working support group for ideas from others managing this. Honest reality: you will have no free time during work week, weekends become only rest time, and many eventually reduce hours or stop working because it's unsustainable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I tell my employer/coworkers about my NTM diagnosis?",
      "answer": "Depends on situation and what you need. If requesting accommodations: have physician write letter describing 'chronic lung condition requiring daily medical treatments and monitoring' without specifying MAC/NTM/bronchiectasis (private medical information). Focus on functional limitations (needs remote work, flexible schedule) rather than diagnosis details. For coworkers: most won't understand the disease even if you explain - it's too complex and unfamiliar. Simple explanation if asked: 'I have a chronic lung condition that requires daily treatments to manage, not contagious.' When you cough, explain: 'Coughing is actually good for me - it's how my body cleanses my lungs. I don't have something in my throat that needs water, I have something in my lungs that needs to come out.' NTMir Insight booklet is excellent patient-friendly explanation you can share if someone genuinely wants to understand. Reality: most family and friends don't 'get it' because you look fine, so coworkers likely won't either unless they see daily impact."

    {
      "question": "What's the Social Security Disability approval criteria for MAC/NTM?",
      "answer": "Requirements: 1) Must not have worked for past 12 months due to health condition. 2) Lung function must be 40% or lower (FEV1). Process typically takes 1+ years with repetitive paperwork and possible exam by December. Some patients approved within 2 months if sent for examination. Long-term disability through employer often initially approved then abruptly denied (even after 3 weeks), requiring appeal. Have pulmonologist document disease severity, treatment challenges, hospitalizations, oxygen requirements, and functional limitations in daily life. Disability attorney can help significantly. Some patients approved for MAC, others for complications (recurrent pneumonia 4-5x/year, aspergillosis, severe exacerbations). Note: being on treatment alone doesn't automatically qualify - must demonstrate severe functional impairment preventing work. Consider: short-term disability first (easier approval), then long-term, then Social Security."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle workplace exposures like renovations, dust, or sick coworkers?",
      "answer": "Renovations (drywall, painting, carpets): Finnish research shows construction materials harbor NTM. Wear N95 mask throughout renovation period. N95 protects from dust/particulates but NOT chemical vapors/fumes (molecules too small). For paint fumes and chemicals: request employer provide air purifier with activated carbon filter PLUS HEPA filter - employer has legal obligation to provide safe work environment regardless of lung disease. Wash hair after shifts with dust exposure. Sick coworkers: mask during flu season, stay current on flu/pneumonia vaccines, keep hand sanitizer at desk, wipe down shared equipment before using. Work-from-home days during illness outbreaks highly valuable. Gym/shared spaces: wipe equipment BEFORE and after use, avoid peak crowding times, assess whether masking needed based on ventilation and carpet cleaning (rarely washed, dust harbors bacteria). Bathroom showers at work: vapor from others' showers lingers - minimize time in space or use different bathroom. Balance protection with quality of life - can't avoid all exposure, but minimize where feasible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I continue working in physically demanding jobs or outdoor careers?",
      "answer": "Yes, many patients continue but with modifications and awareness of limitations. Examples: Campus planner walking 3-5 miles daily continued working but experienced increased breathlessness on stairs; special education teacher managed with PICC line for IV antibiotics (though risky when breaking up student fights); emergency room nurse working 12-hour shifts does airway clearance faithfully but suffers sleep deprivation (6 hours on work nights). Outdoor activities (hiking, biking, camping): absolutely possible with precautions - wear N95 in dusty conditions, mask near waterfalls/misting water, avoid brackish water/retention ponds, use portable nebulizers or battery-powered equipment for camping. Reality check: you may need to slow down, pace yourself differently, take more breaks. Some eventually transition to less physical work or retire early (don't be 'trooper' sacrificing health). Active lifestyle can be form of airway clearance if includes elevation changes and cardio. One patient at 62.5 decided to retire early after complications: 'don't be trooper and sacrifice your health - take the time you need.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I time meals and airway clearance around my work schedule?",
      "answer": "Challenge: airway clearance should be on empty stomach (2 hours after eating), but working creates tight meal timing. Common schedules: Option 1 (early riser): Wake 5:30-6am, do airway clearance immediately (on empty stomach), eat breakfast after completing (~7:30-8am), work 9am-5pm, light lunch, second clearance 4-5pm before dinner (2-3 hours after lunch), dinner 7-8pm. Option 2 (night owl): Wake and eat small breakfast, work 9-5pm, second clearance 9-10pm (3+ hours after early dinner 6-7pm), sleep. Option 3 (12-hour shift worker): Clearance 5:30am, work 7am-7pm with meal at 4pm, second clearance 9-10pm. Many struggle making evening session work and 'dream about just once a day clearance.' Meal timing tricks: eat very small snack (1/4 banana, half cookie) before morning clearance if low blood sugar issue, but keep stomach mostly empty. Rotate body position (back, left side, right side) staying propped up if small amount food. Some do saline-only before exercise/breakfast, then full routine later. Trial and error to find what works for YOUR body and schedule."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I join a support group if I'm still working?",
      "answer": "YES - absolutely valuable, but choose the right one. Most NTM support groups are composed primarily of retirees, which can feel isolating when you're managing full-time work demands. Specific recommendation: Join NTMir's 'Under 50 / Still Working' group (ntm-beunder50@ntminfo.org) - despite name, age cutoff is flexible and group accepts anyone working full-time. This group understands unique challenges: time constraints for airway clearance, navigating workplace accommodations, managing treatment side effects while performing job, lack of understanding from healthy coworkers, financial pressures preventing early retirement. Regular support groups also valuable for medical information sharing and emotional support - many meet via Zoom so you can join regardless of location. Multiple patients emphasize: 'support groups provide understanding family cannot' and 'disease can feel lonely without others who get it.' Groups are upbeat, not depressing - people smile, share humor, celebrate successes. You can join multiple groups serving different needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are realistic expectations for working full-time long-term with BE/NTM?",
      "answer": "Honest reality from many patients: 1) Majority of working-age patients at NTM support groups are retired - being able to work full-time makes you minority. 2) 50%+ eventually reduce hours, retire early, or go on disability because managing disease is effectively full-time job on top of employment. 3) Time demands increase over time: more appointments as disease progresses, more exacerbations requiring treatment adjustment, accumulated fatigue. 4) Sleep deprivation from night symptoms plus early wake times for pre-work clearance worsens outcomes and makes work performance suffer. 5) Quality of life significantly impacted: no free time during work week, weekends only time for rest, socializing minimal, career advancement often sacrificed. 6) Some patients successfully work 5+ years on treatment, others 19 months, others can't manage even diagnosis without treatment. Helpful factors: remote work, supportive employer, vest therapy, financial ability to outsource housework, no children at home, mild disease, minimal side effects. One patient summarizes: 'felt like I'd been hit by a bus by lunchtime.' Another: 'I realized running hard was not helping my health.' Be gentle with yourself and recognize that prioritizing health over career is valid choice, not failure."
