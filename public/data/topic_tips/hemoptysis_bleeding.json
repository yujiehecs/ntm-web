  "key_insights": [
    "Dr. Huit's protocol is paradigm shift for persistent hemoptysis: STOP airway clearance devices, use ONLY 3% saline + postural drainage. Counterintuitive since devices marketed for clearance, but this protocol controlled 12-18 months of problematic bleeding where devices failed. Postural drainage continues even when saline paused - key distinction.",
    "Saline concentration is double-edged sword: 7% more effective for mucus clearance BUT causes hemoptysis in sensitive airways. 3% gentler but less effective. Patients must find personal balance - Debra's 3-day 3% / 1-day 7% rotation eliminated monthly bleeding while maintaining efficacy. Some can't tolerate ANY saline.",
    "Albuterol as hidden hemoptysis trigger: Not commonly discussed but multiple patients identify it as culprit. Saline + albuterol combination particularly problematic. Trial elimination if having recurrent episodes - may solve issue without sacrificing clearance.",
    "Psychological toll disproportionate to medical danger: 'Extreme terror and anxiety,' 'ruined quality of my life,' 'rarely go out anymore' - yet doctors often dismiss as 'nothing to be concerned about.' Gap between medical assessment (usually benign) and patient experience (disabling fear) needs bridging. Fear decreases with repeated exposure but initial impact severe.",
    "Bronchiectasis is primary cause, not MAC: Critical diagnostic distinction. BE creates fragile, damaged airways prone to bleeding from irritation. MAC infection is secondary factor. This explains why hemoptysis continues even with MAC treatment - underlying BE remains.",
    "Throat vs lung bleeding requires different management: Forceful coughing wounds throat, mimicking hemoptysis. Clue: appears after aggressive coughing fits. Treatment: cough gently, use cough drops, soothe throat, avoid clearing. Resolves in days. Different from lung bleeding which requires stopping ACT.",
    "Individual tolerance to saline varies wildly: Some use 7% daily with zero issues. Others can't restart even 0.3% without bleeding days later. Marie had to abandon nebulizing entirely. Trial-and-error required - no universal protocol works for all BE severity levels.",
    "Hemoptysis as treatment motivator: Renee's insight - 'Had it not been for coughing up blood I never would have done treatment. It saved my life.' Fear becomes catalyst for action. While psychologically distressing, hemoptysis often prompts patients to seek diagnosis and treatment they might otherwise delay."

  "common_questions": [
    {
      "question": "When should I call my doctor about coughing up blood?",
      "answer": "Contact doctor if you cough up more than 1 tablespoon of BRIGHT RED blood. Small streaks, pink-tinged sputum, or less than a tablespoon is usually not medically concerning (though understandably scary). Track your episodes - if becoming more frequent or larger amounts, discuss pattern with doctor even if each episode is below tablespoon threshold."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I stop using my nebulizer and vest when I cough up blood?",
      "answer": "Yes. Stop nebulizing saline for 24-48 hours (48 hours if blood unnerves you). For persistent/recurring hemoptysis, try Dr. Huit's protocol: STOP all airway clearance devices permanently and use ONLY 3% nebulized saline followed by postural drainage. Continue postural drainage even on days you skip saline. This counterintuitive approach has controlled bleeding for years in patients where devices caused problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is 7% saline causing my hemoptysis? Should I switch to 3%?",
      "answer": "Very likely if you have frequent bleeding. 7% is 'too rough' for some people's airways, especially with bronchiectasis. Switch to 3% saline permanently, or try rotation: 3 days of 3% then 1 day of 7%. Debra eliminated monthly bleeding episodes with this rotation. When restarting after bleeding, mix 7% with 0.9% to dilute. Some patients can't tolerate even 0.3% without bleeding - may need to abandon nebulizing entirely."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could my albuterol be causing the blood?",
      "answer": "Possibly. Albuterol can cause hemoptysis in some patients with sensitive bronchiectasis airways. If having recurrent bleeding, try eliminating albuterol for 2-4 weeks to see if episodes stop. Pamela found both saline AND albuterol contributed to large clot episodes - stopped both and bleeding reduced significantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I cope with the extreme anxiety and fear from hemoptysis?",
      "answer": "Strategies that help: (1) Use slow, measured breathing during episodes to calm yourself, (2) Track episodes and have action plan ready so you feel in control, (3) Remember fear DOES decrease over time with repeated exposure, (4) Know that bronchiectasis (not MAC) usually causes it and it's 'oftentimes nothing to be concerned about' medically, (5) Focus on what you CAN control: rest, hydration, gentle breathing, following your plan. Consider talking to mental health professional at your treatment center about disease-specific anxiety."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I do if blood keeps appearing on and off for several days?",
      "answer": "For lingering hemoptysis: (1) Stop ALL airway clearance 48+ hours until completely clear for several days, (2) Back off exercise - only gentle stretching and breathing, (3) Rest more and stay calm, (4) Check medications/supplements that thin blood (aspirin, fish oil, vitamin E, ginkgo), (5) Drink more water to thin secretions, (6) Avoid irritants like coffee and citrus. When restarting saline, mix 7% with 0.9% to dilute."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the blood coming from my throat or my lungs?",
      "answer": "Key clue: Does it appear after aggressive coughing fits? If so, likely throat wound from forceful coughing. Throat bleeding: avoid clearing throat, use cough drops to lubricate, cough very gently when necessary, soothe with drinks. Resolves in several days. Lung bleeding: appears with or without coughing, requires stopping airway clearance for 24-48 hours. If unsure, treat as lung bleeding to be safe."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I cough up large clots, not just streaks?",
      "answer": "Stop ALL airway clearance including nebulizing for 48 hours minimum (some doctors say 24 hours OK). Contact your pulmonologist to document the episode. There is medication available to help severe hemoptysis - ask about it if happening frequently. Many patients with confirmed bronchiectasis as cause choose to 'deal with it and move on' once they know it's not dangerous, but medication is option if quality of life severely impacted."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I keep doing postural drainage when I skip nebulizer due to blood?",
      "answer": "Yes! This is key part of Dr. Huit's protocol. Stop devices and nebulizing when bleeding, but CONTINUE postural drainage every day. Postural drainage uses gravity to move secretions without the mechanical irritation of devices or chemical irritation of saline. It maintains clearance while giving airways time to heal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do I cough up blood every other month like clockwork?",
      "answer": "Likely pattern related to: (1) Bacterial load cycling (unfriendly bacteria cause occasional irritation), (2) Airway sensitivity to environmental changes (seasons, humidity), (3) Accumulated irritation from aggressive ACT reaching threshold every 4-6 weeks. Track what you're doing 24-48 hours before each episode - any pattern with saline concentration, device intensity, exercise, or environmental exposure? Discussing tracked pattern with doctor more useful than isolated incidents."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I add afternoon saline to prevent hemoptysis?",
      "answer": "Some patients find adding gentle 0.9% saline in afternoon (after morning 7%) helps prevent hemoptysis, especially if you have persistent bacteria causing irritation. The milder afternoon saline soothes airways. However, if you're already having hemoptysis, adding MORE saline won't help - need to reduce concentration or frequency, not increase."
