      "tip": "BRINSUPRI (brensocatib) is the first FDA-approved drug specifically for bronchiectasis (August 2025), but Dr. McShane emphasizes it's 'not sufficient alone' and requires multi-modal approach with mucoactive agents, airway clearance techniques, and macrolide therapy when appropriate. Clinical trials showed reduced exacerbations vs placebo and 25mg dose slowed FEV1 decline, but improvements typically seen around 6 months and drug stabilizes declining function rather than reversing existing damage. Critical limitation: trial excluded active NTM infection patients, creating uncertainty about effectiveness in broader real-world population. Some very symptomatic patients report 'getting their lives back' after 1-2 months, others experience no change or must discontinue due to side effects.",

Dr. Daley's YouTube presentation explains safety profile and why doesn't suppress immunity - National Jewish will prescribe for NTM patients. Mechanism: DPP-1 inhibitor reducing inflammation from neutrophil over-activation. Dosing: 10mg or 25mg once daily oral. Contraindication: live vaccines should be avoided. Patient expectation management critical - not a magic pill replacement for airway clearance."

Community reports one trial participant lost all teeth requiring dentures (anecdotal). However, published PMC journal study analyzing 24 weeks treatment found NO increased periodontal disease progression vs placebo - hyperkeratosis and periodontitis/gingivitis occurred but 'not at much higher rate' than placebo. Patient reactions vary: some with existing dental issues declining treatment (96-year-old afraid of losing 'great depression teeth'), others with pristine teeth proceeding with monitoring as doctors 'not concerned at all.'",

Recommendations: comprehensive dental exam before starting to establish baseline, frank discussion with dentist if existing periodontal disease, maintain rigorous dental hygiene during treatment (brushing, flossing, regular cleanings), request dental monitoring schedule from prescribing doctor. If exacerbations significantly impacting quality of life, dental monitoring may be reasonable tradeoff."

Manufacturer Insmed offers InLighten Patient Support Program with copay assistance up to $35,000 for private insurance patients - after using $35k subsidy, cost goes to insurance deductible (~$2,100), then reduced copay (~$36/month post-deductible). Medicare patients often don't qualify for manufacturer assistance due to income restrictions and federal regulations. Major unresolved issue from Insmed August 12 conference call: insurers may only cover patients with 2+ exacerbations/year despite FDA's broad approval label (all NCFB ages 12+), as payors want to match clinical trial population criteria.",

Strategy: enroll in InLighten immediately, ask pharmacy about manufacturer copay cards/pardons, document exacerbation history carefully as insurers may require 2+ exacerbations despite broad FDA label, plan for long-term affordability after subsidies expire. Medicare vs private insurance makes dramatic difference in out-of-pocket costs."

    {
      "question": "Should I take BRINSUPRI if I have active untreated NTM infection?",
      "answer": "Doctors disagree on this - BRINSUPRI clinical trials excluded patients with active NTM infections, creating uncertainty. Some pulmonologists won't prescribe for active untreated NTM due to immune system concerns, while other doctors including some at National Jewish prescribe despite active infection. One National Jewish ID doctor recommended it for 80-year-old not on NTM meds as 'true candidate.' Get opinions from both your pulmonologist AND infectious disease specialist. Dr. Daley explains in his YouTube presentation why drug is considered safe and doesn't suppress overall immunity. Key consideration: you differ from trial population so effectiveness uncertain in your specific case."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are BRINSUPRI's dental risks worth the exacerbation benefits?",
      "answer": "Risk/benefit balance depends on your individual situation. Drug info lists 'gum and tooth-related side effects' requiring dental monitoring, related to DPP-1 deficiency syndrome. One trial participant reportedly lost all teeth (anecdotal), scaring some patients. However, published study analyzing 24 weeks treatment found NO increased periodontal disease progression vs placebo - side effects occurred but 'not at much higher rate.' If you have pristine teeth and good hygiene, some doctors not concerned. If you have existing periodontal disease, have frank discussion with dentist. If exacerbations significantly impacting quality of life (some report 'getting their lives back'), dental monitoring may be reasonable tradeoff. Schedule comprehensive dental exam before starting, maintain rigorous hygiene during treatment."

    {
      "question": "How do I find and qualify for clinical trials?",
      "answer": "Start with clinicaltrials.gov (official NIH database) and NTMIR resources for NTM-specific trials. MAC2v3 study shows trials can be accessible - 22 sites from Hawaii to Texas to Toronto, not just major academic centers. Review exclusion criteria carefully before applying - many trials exclude active infections, specific comorbidities, or patients not meeting disease severity thresholds. BRINSUPRI trials required exacerbation history; compassionate use only available to prior trial participants. Ask potential trial coordinators: 'How similar am I to your target population?' Phase 3 trials test effectiveness in larger populations most similar to real-world patients. Patient advisory committees in some trials give community voice. Register for notifications to hear about opportunities early."

    {
      "question": "What does MAC2v3 study mean for my MAC treatment?",

If successful when results released October 2025, could allow many patients to eliminate rifampin, dramatically reducing side effect burden (drug interactions, liver issues, GI problems). Study enrolled 474 patients across 22 sites - participants representative of real-world MAC population (most have bronchiectasis, ~40% smear positive, ~2/3 use airway clearance). If you're starting Big 3 and struggling with side effects, wait for results in late 2025 to inform whether continuation necessary. Results can't be reported until 12-month data collection completes.

      "question": "Does BRINSUPRI mean I can stop airway clearance and nebulizers?",
      "answer": "Absolutely NOT. Dr. McShane's editorial emphasizes BRINSUPRI is 'not sufficient alone' and requires multi-modal strategy including mucoactive agents, airway clearance techniques, and macrolide therapy when appropriate. He states it's 'unrealistic to expect one drug to meet every patient's needs' given bronchiectasis complexity. BRINSUPRI reduces inflammation from neutrophil over-activation (DPP-1 inhibition) but doesn't replace mechanical mucus clearance. Trial results showed reduced exacerbations and slowed FEV1 decline, but drug stabilizes declining function rather than reversing existing damage. Some very symptomatic patients report significant improvement after 1-2 months, others no change or discontinuation. Even with BRINSUPRI, continue nebulizers, vests, saline, and other prescribed therapies - bronchiectasis requires 'equally nuanced approach' as other chronic diseases per Dr. McShane."
