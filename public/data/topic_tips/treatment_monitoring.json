    "Inhaled antibiotics (Arikayce, BRINSUPRI) offer alternatives for refractory disease or patients intolerant of oral/IV regimens. Patient assistance programs can help with substantial costs.",
    "Species-specific considerations matter: M. simiae and M. intracellulare may have different treatment responses and duration needs compared to M. avium. Consult NTM specialists for species-specific guidance.",
    "Exacerbation definition is critical for consistent communication between patients and providers: increased symptoms (cough, dyspnea, sputum, fatigue) lasting ≥48 hours and requiring treatment escalation, distinct from daily fluctuations.",
    "Patient anxiety about side effects versus disease progression is extremely common and can be paralyzing. Balanced perspective is needed: treatment tolerance varies dramatically (some patients have minimal side effects, others cannot tolerate any treatment), and individual responses are unpredictable from forum discussions.",
    "Environmental controls (sterile water, equipment sterilization) remain critical even after treatment completion due to high reinfection risk. These are lifelong precautions, not temporary measures during active treatment."

  "common_questions": [
    {
      "question": "How often should I have blood work during treatment?",
      "answer": "Varies widely: weekly for IV antibiotics initially, monthly to quarterly for stable oral treatment—discuss specific plan with your physician"
    },
    {
      "question": "What lab values indicate I need to stop treatment?",
      "answer": "ALT/AST >3-5x upper limit of normal is concerning for liver toxicity; significant hearing loss or vision changes; rising creatinine indicating kidney damage"
    },
    {
      "question": "When will my CT scan show improvement?",
      "answer": "6-month mark is key evaluation point; stability is often success; some patients show minimal imaging improvement despite symptom improvement and culture conversion"
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I get sputum cultures during treatment?",
      "answer": "Monthly is common during active treatment; quarterly for some stable patients—varies by clinic protocol"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does 'culture conversion' mean exactly?",
      "answer": "Three consecutive negative monthly sputum cultures; typically takes 3-6 months, occasionally up to 12 months"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do guidelines say 12 months of treatment after culture conversion?",
      "answer": "Weak evidence base: 'very low certainty in estimates'; no randomized trials support this duration; 9 months post-conversion may be adequate for nodular disease per Korean studies"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it normal for side effects to get worse over time?",
      "answer": "Yes, cumulative toxicity often increases rather than decreases; report escalating side effects promptly"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I work full-time during treatment?",
      "answer": "Possible but challenging; fatigue is most limiting factor; many patients reduce hours or take medical leave"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my CT gets worse but I feel better?",
      "answer": "Discuss antibiotic blood level testing with physician to ensure adequate drug absorption; 6-month mark is critical evaluation point"
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I treat tree-in-bud findings on CT even without positive cultures?",
      "answer": "Controversial: some treat based on imaging alone, others wait for culture confirmation; discuss individualized approach with physician"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did I get reinfected after completing treatment successfully?",
      "answer": "Reinfection from environmental sources is more common than relapse—48% recurrence rate; emphasizes need for lifelong environmental precautions"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I can't tolerate the Big 3 antibiotics?",
      "answer": "Multiple alternatives exist: inhaled antibiotics (Arikayce, BRINSUPRI), IV aminoglycosides, azithromycin maintenance, or watchful waiting for selected patients"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I stop treatment if side effects are intolerable?",
      "answer": "Yes, this is sometimes the right decision for quality of life; discuss ongoing monitoring plan and criteria for restarting if needed"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if I'm having an exacerbation versus normal symptom fluctuation?",
      "answer": "Exacerbation: increased symptoms lasting ≥48 hours requiring treatment escalation, not resolving spontaneously"
    },
    {
      "question": "What water should I use to rinse my nebulizer cups?",
      "answer": "Only sterile water for final rinse—never tap water, even if boiled or filtered; Dr. Falkinham emphasizes this critical safety measure"
