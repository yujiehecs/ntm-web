  "common_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Am I a candidate for surgery?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What are the success rates for MAC surgery?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How long is recovery from lung surgery?",
      "answer": "Hospital stay 3-5 days. Minimally invasive: return to light work 2-3 weeks, full recovery 6 months. Traditional thoracotomy: return to work 2-3 months, full recovery 6-12 months. Energy/stamina takes longer to recover than physical healing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I need IV amikacin before surgery?",
      "answer": "Protocol varies - NJH typically requires 6-10 weeks IV amikacin pre-op, but some surgeons don't require it especially if sensitivity testing shows resistance. Discuss alternatives if you have tinnitus/balance concerns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can surgery cure my MAC?",
      "answer": "Surgery removes the bacterial reservoir (cavity/destroyed tissue) but doesn't guarantee cure - residual bacteria remain in lungs. Must continue antibiotics 12 months post-op. Many achieve long-term remission (10-20+ years) with diligent airway clearance, but reinfection remains possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I wait to see if antibiotics close my cavity or have surgery now?",
      "answer": "Japanese studies recommend surgery if cavity doesn't respond after 6 months antibiotics. Waiting too long allows disease progression, making surgery more extensive/risky. Best outcomes when surgery done early while disease localized and lung function good."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the major risks of lung surgery?",
      "answer": "Post-op mortality 0-23%, morbidity 0-50% depending on procedure extent. Common complications: nerve pain (usually temporary), persistent numbness, fatigue, breathlessness if extensive resection, air leaks, infections. Specialist NTM surgeons have lower complication rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which surgeon should I choose for NTM lung surgery?",
      "answer": "Dr. John Mitchell (University of Colorado/NJH) and Dr. James Caccitolo (Tyler, TX) most frequently recommended. Choose high-volume thoracic surgeon experienced specifically with bronchiectasis/NTM patients, not general thoracic surgeon."
