The nebulizer opens airways while the vest compresses them, working against each other. However, many physicians approve simultaneous use because the time commitment (50-60 min sequential vs 30 min simultaneous) affects compliance.

  "key_insights": [
    "Aerobika/OPEP devices are prescribed for twice-daily use indefinitely - it's a lifetime commitment for bronchiectasis and NTM patients, not just during active infection.",
    "The timing controversy (simultaneous vs sequential use with vest/nebulizer) reflects real trade-offs between optimal technique and patient compliance - Dr. McShane recommends sequential, but many doctors approve simultaneous use to reduce time burden from 50-60 minutes to 30 minutes.",
    "Annual replacement is required even though devices may seem to work fine - the internal mechanisms degrade over time, and manufacturer guidelines specify 1-year maximum use.",
    "Albuterol jitteriness affects many patients but has multiple alternatives (levalbuterol, Atrovent, inhaler instead of nebulizer, or skipping bronchodilator entirely if PFT shows no benefit).",
    "Sterilization methods are flexible - baby bottle sterilizers, boiling, microwave steam bags, and dishwasher sanitize cycles all work, allowing patients to choose what fits their lifestyle.",
    "The 'not producing sputum' phenomenon doesn't mean airway clearance is unnecessary - antibiotics dry secretions temporarily, and preventative clearance is as important as clearing active mucus.",
    "Exercise significantly enhances Aerobika effectiveness - the combination of aerobic activity + ACT produces better clearance than ACT alone for many patients.",
    "Hard water mineral buildup is a common frustration but solvable with vinegar additions or distilled water reuse strategies that reduce costs."

  "common_questions": [
    {
      "question": "How long does an Aerobika last before I need to replace it?",
      "answer": "The manufacturer recommends replacing after one year or if damaged, as stated in the product insert. Many patients use devices for several years, but the internal mechanisms can degrade even when the device appears to flutter normally. Budget about $50-60 annually for replacement from medical supply companies like SaveRite Medical, as insurance rarely covers replacements within the warranty period."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use my nebulizer, vest, and Aerobika all at the same time to save time?",
      "answer": "This is debated. Dr. Pamela McShane at National Jewish Health recommends sequential use (nebulizer first, then vest/Aerobika) because the nebulizer opens airways while the vest compresses them. However, many physicians approve simultaneous use because doing everything sequentially takes 50-60 minutes vs 30 minutes simultaneously, and compliance suffers when treatment is too time-consuming. Discuss with your doctor which approach fits your life - perfect technique doesn't help if you can't maintain it."
    },
    {
      "question": "I'm not coughing up any mucus during airway clearance - should I reduce to once daily?",
      "answer": "No, continue twice daily even without sputum production. Airway clearance is both preventative and curative - it's needed 'in sickness and in health' according to multiple patients and physicians. Antibiotics temporarily dry secretions, and lack of visible sputum doesn't mean clearance isn't working. Twice-daily treatment is the gold standard for bronchiectasis and NTM patients."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best time of day for airway clearance sessions?",
      "answer": "Most patients do first session upon waking on an empty stomach (most productive time), then struggle with timing the second. Common successful schedules: early afternoon (12-4pm) before dinner, late evening (10pm, 3+ hours post-dinner), or right after work (5pm). The key is maintaining at least 6 hours between sessions and choosing timing you can stick with consistently. Dr. Daley has endorsed flexible timing as long as twice-daily compliance is maintained."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should I sterilize my Aerobika - is boiling the only way?",
      "answer": "Multiple methods work: (1) Baby bottle sterilizers with sterilize + dry cycle (Philips Avent, Bololo brands), (2) Boil for 10 minutes, (3) Microwave steam bags (Medela brand, 3 minutes), or (4) Dishwasher sanitize cycle at 140°F with parts in a fine mesh bag. All achieve sterilization. After each use, disassemble and soak in Dawn dish soap water, rinse thoroughly, then sterilize. Sterilized parts stored in sealed bags stay sterile indefinitely."
    },
    {
      "question": "Albuterol makes me really jittery - do I have to use it with my Aerobika?",
      "answer": "No. Try these alternatives: (1) Switch to levalbuterol (less jittery for most people), (2) Use 2 puffs of levalbuterol inhaler instead of nebulized, (3) Try Atrovent (ipratropium) bronchodilator, or (4) Ask for a PFT test to see if bronchodilator actually improves your lung function - some patients get no benefit and can skip it entirely. Many successfully use 3% saline alone with Aerobika."
    },
    {
      "question": "My Aerobika only flutters when I hold it upside down - is this normal?",
      "answer": "The Aerobika is designed to work in any position, so if your device is less than a year old and only works upside down, it's defective. Contact Monaghan Medical customer service for a replacement - they provide good customer support. However, using it upside down is effective if that's what works for you temporarily. For older devices, try monthly vinegar soaks (3 cups water + 3 cups vinegar for 1 hour) to clean the mechanism."
    },
    {
      "question": "I get lightheaded and faint when using the Aerobika - am I doing something wrong?",
      "answer": "You're probably starting too aggressively. Begin with just 10 breaths 4 times daily rather than 20-minute sessions. One patient spent an afternoon in bed after 30 breaths on first try. Respiratory therapists often recommend shorter, more frequent sessions initially, then gradually work up to the recommended 10-20 minutes twice daily over several weeks as your body adapts to the breathing technique."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where's the best place to buy replacement Aerobika devices?",
      "answer": "Buy from reputable medical supply companies like SaveRite Medical (around $50-60). Avoid eBay, Mercari, and similar marketplaces - devices there may be diverted from hospital inventory or previously used. Insurance rarely covers replacements within the 1-year period, so expect to pay out-of-pocket annually. The UDI stamp doesn't guarantee a device is unused or authentic."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I combine Aerobika use with exercise for better airway clearance?",
      "answer": "Yes! Many patients find exercise (hiking, biking, fast walking, swimming) combined with Aerobika more effective than Aerobika alone. Exercise naturally loosens mucus, then Aerobika and postural drainage help clear it. Some patients report exercise produces more sputum than any ACT device. Swimming is particularly effective due to the prone position and breathing rhythm."
