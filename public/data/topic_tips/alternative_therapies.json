      "question": "Should I take supplements to boost my immune system for NTM?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Is it safe to take iron supplements with NTM?",
      "answer": "Requires specialist consultation. Iron feeds pseudomonas and possibly NTM. If true iron deficiency (ferritin <30), may need supplementation but watch for infection flares. Rule out GI bleeding first. Prefer dietary iron increase and monitoring over supplements when possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I choose not to take the Big 3 antibiotics?",
      "answer": "Yes, under specialist care. Watch-and-wait valid for asymptomatic/mild disease without cavities. Requires strict twice-daily airway clearance, regular CT scans, weight maintenance, specialist monitoring. Some patients at NYU Langone and National Jewish followed for years without treatment.

    },
    {
      "question": "Does manuka honey help NTM?",

      "question": "What probiotics should I take during antibiotic treatment?",

    {
      "question": "Can hyperbaric oxygen or salt caves help my lungs?",

    {
      "question": "Should I avoid antioxidant supplements?",
