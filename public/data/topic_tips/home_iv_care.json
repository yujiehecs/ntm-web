  "common_questions": [
    {
      "question": "How long does an IV amikacin infusion take at home?",
      "answer": "The medication infusion itself takes approximately 20 minutes, but allow 15+ minutes afterward to sit before standing due to potential balance issues. Total time including setup, flushing, infusion, and post-treatment monitoring is typically 45-60 minutes per session."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the most important thing to remember for PICC line care?",
      "answer": "Flushing the PICC line thoroughly before AND after each infusion is the single most critical step emphasized by experienced patients. This prevents infections and maintains line patency. Combine this with proper hand washing before and after procedures."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I manage home IV amikacin if I live far from a medical center?",
      "answer": "Yes - rural and remote patients successfully manage home IV therapy when properly trained by nursing staff. Make sure you receive thorough training, written instructions, website resources, and a reliable nurse phone number for questions. Some patients have spouses/family members help with administration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to go to the clinic for every IV amikacin dose?",
      "answer": "Not usually - a common approach is one clinic infusion per week (often combined with blood work for amikacin levels and liver function monitoring) with remaining doses administered at home. For example, if you're doing 3x weekly, you might do one at the clinic and two at home."
    },
    {
      "question": "What form does IV amikacin come in for home use?",
      "answer": "Amikacin typically comes in an elastomeric ball-form infusion device that's easy to use at home. This delivery system is simpler than traditional IV bags and pumps, making home administration more manageable without complex equipment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I self-administer if I have vision problems?",
      "answer": "Significant vision issues make self-administration difficult because the procedures require good visual acuity to maintain sterile technique and accurately perform steps. If you have vision impairment, plan to have a family member or caregiver help with the administration."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much training should I expect before doing home IV care?",
      "answer": "For standard IV amikacin alone, expect thorough nursing training sessions covering sterile technique, flushing procedures, and troubleshooting. For complex multi-IV regimens (especially M. abscessus protocols), some patients receive 6 weeks of hospital-based training before transitioning to home care."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do I feel unbalanced after IV amikacin infusions?",
      "answer": "Balance issues are a common side effect of IV amikacin. Plan to sit for at least 15 minutes after completing the infusion before trying to stand or walk. This waiting period helps prevent falls and allows your body to adjust to the medication."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I ask during my PICC line training session?",
      "answer": "Be assertive: ask questions repeatedly until confident, request written instructions, ask for website resources with procedures, ensure you have a good phone number for the nurse, and ask about troubleshooting common problems. Don't leave the training session until you feel comfortable performing all steps independently."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does home IV care affect quality of life?",
      "answer": "Many patients find home IV care empowering because it gives them control over this aspect of their treatment. After proper training, patients report feeling confident managing PICC lines at home, which is better than repeated clinic visits. However, it does require commitment to sterile technique and time management for infusions."
