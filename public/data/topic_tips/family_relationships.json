  "common_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Should my family get tested if I have NTM or bronchiectasis?",
      "answer": "Yes, if multiple family members have NTM or bronchiectasis, consider genetic testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis carrier status, immunodeficiency disorders, and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Family clusters appear even when members lived in different states for decades, suggesting genetic susceptibility. CF carrier status seems particularly common in NTM/BE patients."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get my family to understand that this disease is serious?",
      "answer": "Combine multiple approaches: (1) Send them NTMir's free 'Insight' patient booklet - professionally written explanation works better than your repeated attempts, (2) Make your daily routine visible - let them see the hours spent nebulizing, boiling, sterilizing, (3) Have a formal family meeting with concrete information about time commitments and reduced capacity, (4) Share specific impacts like being out of work, not just general 'I'm sick' statements. Looking healthy makes this harder - they need to see/read about what they can't see."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it normal to feel lonely and isolated with this disease?",
      "answer": "Absolutely - this is described as 'a lonely disease' by many patients because it's rare, complex, and misunderstood. Most family/friends won't spend time trying to understand it, and looking healthy makes others minimize it. Join NTM support groups (most meet via Zoom so location doesn't matter) - they provide the understanding family often cannot. Many patients are in multiple support groups for this reason."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I do if my spouse/partner is unsupportive?",
      "answer": "Try: (1) Educational materials - NTMir's Insight booklet, Insmed's 'BE SEEN' table book, AboutNTM.com's 'Inside the Lung Damage' video, (2) Have partner attend specialist appointments (especially at NJH) to hear directly from experts, (3) Consider couples therapy focused on chronic illness, (4) Recognize some partners respond with avoidance/denial/fear rather than lack of caring. However, if partner's dismissiveness significantly impacts your mental health, that negative impact may be more damaging than leaving the relationship."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle people who think I'm contagious when I cough?",
      "answer": "Get free 'My Cough Is Not Contagious' buttons from NTMir (ntminfo.org) to wear in public. For people who know you, explain: 'Coughing is how my body cleanses my lungs - I have something in my lungs that needs to come out, not something in my throat that requires water.' Also remind them: 'I'm MORE of a danger to you than you are to me' - you're immunocompromised and vulnerable to THEIR respiratory infections."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I leave an environmental situation if my family thinks I'm overreacting?",
      "answer": "Trust your body's symptoms over family's opinions. If you're experiencing increased respiratory symptoms, headaches, mucus production, or other reactions to environmental hazards (poor air quality, mold, water exposure), prioritize leaving even if causing relationship conflict. Your family's body may tolerate the environment while yours reacts violently - this doesn't make your reaction invalid."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I help my adult children understand my disease?",
      "answer": "Give them concrete information rather than general statements. Explain specific hours spent on airway clearance, describe test procedures in detail, share appointment frequency and travel commitments. Adult children often need eye-opening specifics about time commitments to truly understand impact on your life and capacity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it worth educating friends about NTM or should I just avoid talking about it?",
      "answer": "Most patients find it exhausting to explain repeatedly and choose to 'just do what I need to do each day, and try not to bring it up in conversation.' Focus education efforts on immediate family using professional materials. For friends, brief explanations when they ask about specific precautions usually suffice. Many patients rely on support groups for disease-related conversations rather than burdening friendships."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my family forget I have this disease?",
      "answer": "Because you look healthy and disease management happens mostly at home, family members 'forget about it a lot.' Some may also use forgetting as coping mechanism - they can't bear thinking about your fragile health so pretend everything is okay. Bring it up yourself and let them know how you're doing - don't wait for them to ask."
    },
    {
      "question": "What genetic testing should I consider if family members also have lung disease?",
      "answer": "Request testing for: (1) Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, (2) Cystic fibrosis carrier status (common in NTM/BE patients), (3) Immunodeficiency disorders, (4) Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. Kaiser and other major medical systems can run comprehensive genetic panels. If you're a CF carrier, inform family members especially if children are planning families, as having two carrier parents creates CF risk for offspring."
