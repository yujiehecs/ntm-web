      "tip": "National Jewish Hospital (Denver) offers 7-10 day comprehensive evaluations with extensive testing including: CT scans, PFT testing, bronchoscopy with BAL if needed, GERD testing (often two tests), alpha-1 testing, cystic fibrosis screening, genetic predisposition testing, rheumatoid arthritis testing, hearing/eye tests, and detailed airway clearance training with vest therapy. The program schedules all tests within your visit window (8am-5pm weekdays) with breaks between appointments. You meet your pulmonologist on the first day to confirm/modify testing schedule, complete testing mid-week, and receive treatment recommendations on the final day with both pulmonology and infectious disease doctors. The comprehensive nature means they test for underlying conditions that local clinics often miss. After your initial evaluation, NJH requires follow-up visits every 6 months initially (graduates to 9-12 months if stable), though they manage care through your local pulmonologist and are responsive to messages for questions between visits. The evaluation typically costs $1,000+ out of pocket even with insurance, plus travel expenses including 1-2 week hotel stay. Most patients stay at nearby hotels like Residence Inn Cherry Creek (10-minute Uber from hospital, has kitchen). Some patients can opt out of specific tests if recently completed locally to shorten visit to 5 days, though this requires discussing with scheduler.",

(2) Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) - has team approach with pulmonology + infectious disease + pharmacologist working together, Dr. Timothy Aksamit is head of pulmonology and board member of NTMIR, provides comprehensive care though less extensive initial testing than NJH. Mayo Phoenix does NOT have NTM specialty clinic. (3) Johns Hopkins (Baltimore, MD) - Has NTM clinic on Fridays at Bayview location with several doctors including Dr. Belz, doctors consult with each other on cases, good for mid-Atlantic region but program less comprehensive than NJH (patients schedule own GERD testing, CF testing, physical therapy training, etc.). (4) UT Health Tyler (Texas) - Center of Excellence with long history as former TB institution, Dr. Pamela McShane was prominent specialist (recently relocated to Washington state), multiple doctors continue program with team approach. (5) Stanford (Palo Alto, CA) - Has NTM program but patient feedback is mixed; some report not impressed with care and subsequently went to Mayo with far superior experience. For Bay Area patients, National Jewish is closer option than Mayo Minnesota. (6) University of Washington (Seattle) - Has knowledgeable MAC doctors who recommended patient go to NJH when seeing Dr. Kasperbauer and Dr. Daley, indicating they recognize NJH as best even when confident in their own treatment abilities. When choosing between centers, consider: distance from home, insurance coverage, comprehensiveness of initial evaluation needed, and whether you need ongoing treatment management or just diagnostic consultation.",

Some major medical centers have collaborations with NTM centers of excellence - for example, Thomas Jefferson University (Philadelphia) has collaboration with National Jewish Health and has dedicated NTM care team. If you live in regions with few listed doctors (like Illinois has few, Indiana has none as of Feb 2025), you can request NTMIR staff reach out to your current doctor if they are knowledgeable about NTM treatment. Specific regional recommendations from patients include: Greater Philadelphia area - Dr. Leah Lande (main line suburbs, pulmonologist and NTM specialist with published research), Dr. Conrad Reed (Abington), U Penn is part of Care Center Network; Tampa/St. Petersburg - Directory lists several options though individual doctor experiences vary; DMV area (DC/Maryland/Virginia) - Hopkins Bayview NTM clinic (Fridays) with multiple doctors, Georgetown has Ann O'Donnell who is active in NTM conferences.

      "tip": "A good local pulmonologist who is NTM-knowledgeable can effectively manage stable bronchiectasis and MAC with watchful waiting, regular CT scans, sputum cultures, and airway clearance guidance. Signs your local doctor is adequate: they follow NTM treatment guidelines, order appropriate testing intervals (CT scans, PFTs, sputum cultures), are knowledgeable about airway clearance techniques, and communicate responsively. However, consider traveling to center of excellence if: (1) Local doctor unsure about treatment decisions or admits NTM is outside their expertise, (2) Disease is progressing and you need comprehensive testing to identify underlying causes (GERD, CF, immune deficiencies, alpha-1, etc.), (3) Starting complex antibiotic treatment (the 'Big 3') especially if have cavities - infectious disease specialist essential for drug monitoring, dosing adjustments, and managing side effects, (4) Local doctor unresponsive to prescription refills, test result questions, or flare-ups, (5) Need confirmation that current watchful waiting approach is appropriate vs should start treatment. Many patients successfully use hybrid approach: get comprehensive initial evaluation at center of excellence (NJH, Mayo, UT Tyler) which creates treatment plan, then have local pulmonologist implement daily care while center monitors via periodic sputum samples and annual visits. Centers like NJH can prescribe medications to out-of-state patients and remain available for questions, while local doctor handles routine monitoring and urgent issues. The key is having trustworthy local doctor who respects center of excellence recommendations and communicates well with specialist team. Patient reported seeing local pulmonologist who validated watchful waiting after NJH evaluation and encouraged 'living life happily' rather than being consumed by prevention measures - this balanced perspective valuable when disease is stable.",

Creating FedEx account provides discounted shipping rates. (4) Local testing coordination: CT scans, PFTs, blood work, and other monitoring can be done locally with results sent to center, reduces travel frequency, (5) Communication: Centers like NJH responsive to MyChart messages and phone calls for questions between visits, though accessing detailed test results through patient portal can be challenging. Some patients report difficulty getting full culture results or having local doctor access records despite multiple attempts. (6) Prescription management: Centers can prescribe to out-of-state patients including specialty medications, though some states have restrictions (particularly for IV medications like Amikacin which must be administered in hospital where center has no privileges). Confirm prescription management before traveling. (7) Local doctor coordination: Essential to have local pulmonologist and/or infectious disease doctor who will implement center recommendations, handle emergencies, and provide routine care. Centers design treatment programs but may require local doctor to actually prescribe and monitor. Cost considerations: Initial evaluation $1,000+ out-pocket even with insurance, hotel 1-2 weeks ($700-1,400), flights, shipping sputum samples ($38-96 every 2 months = $228-576/year), annual follow-up visits. Mayo won't accept some insurance plans; verify coverage before scheduling. For patients living 3-5 hours from center, driving for appointments is common.",

Testing primarily occurs in first 3 days, day 4 focuses on treatment planning based on results. Patients can discuss with schedulers about shortening visit if they've had recent testing locally and want to opt out of redundant tests.

One patient's barium swallow test revealed reflux aspirating up to collarbone level during inverted positions, despite having zero acid discomfort or heartburn. NJH's approach to silent reflux management: (1) Diagnostic testing with esophageal pH probe that measures reflux frequency and severity in various positions (lying, sitting, walking, exercising, eating, sleeping) to establish baseline before treatment decisions, (2) Initial treatment focuses on lifestyle modifications: sleeping with head elevated, no alcohol/chocolate/caffeine/coffee, not lying down for 3 hours after eating, avoiding inverted exercise positions (yoga inversions where hips are higher than head), exercising on empty stomach, (3) NJH does NOT recommend treating reflux with PPIs (proton pump inhibitors) long-term due to concerns about creating additional problems - they emphasize importance of stomach acid for killing certain bacteria, (4) If lifestyle changes insufficient, may consider surgical options to tighten the lower esophageal sphincter. The connection: aspiration from reflux introduces bacteria into lungs, contributing to NTM colonization and infection risk.

      "tip": "When deciding whether to proceed with National Jewish Hospital evaluation despite stable disease or good local care, consider that NJH's value extends beyond treating active infection - their comprehensive testing often reveals underlying conditions that explain NTM susceptibility and affect long-term treatment strategy. Patient experiences show NJH discovers conditions missed locally such as: silent reflux causing aspiration (found via barium swallow), genetic predispositions, cystic fibrosis in elderly patients (age 71), immune deficiencies, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Even when current CT scans are stable or improved, underlying causative factors may remain unaddressed. The decision factors: (1) If local doctor clearly states 'colonization but no active infection' and recommends only airway clearance with watchful waiting, but hasn't tested for underlying causes (GERD, CF, immune issues, alpha-1), comprehensive NJH evaluation may identify treatable conditions preventing future progression, (2) Flights and lodging are expensive ($1,000+ out-pocket plus travel), but discovering underlying cause early can change disease trajectory, (3) NJH schedules everything efficiently within 1-2 weeks rather than months of separate appointments locally, (4) If torn about committing 2 weeks for evaluation when disease is stable, remember most patients actually stay 5-7 days once testing is complete, (5) NJH reviews records before accepting patients and won't schedule unnecessary evaluations - if they accept your case, their expert team saw something worth comprehensive workup.

Important scheduling notes: Patients are typically assigned both ID and pulmonology doctors, but if you're only scheduled with one specialty, you can call your NJH patient ambassador to request adding pulmonologist or ID doctor to your schedule - they will accommodate. The multidisciplinary team approach means doctors meet and consult with each other, so one patient chose to see only Dr. Haas again rather than also meeting Dr. Griffith since 'they meet and consult.'

NTM are slow-growing organisms, so centers adjust monitoring frequency based on disease stability: (1) Initial phase: 6-month intervals for both visits and CT scans until specialists understand your case and establish baseline, (2) Stable phase: Annual CT scans with 6-month check-ups, as long as you continue regular sputum samples between visits (NJH requires sputum every 2-3 months), (3) Progression detected: Return to 6-month CT scan intervals. The rationale: CT scans involve radiation exposure, so doctors prescribe minimum necessary based on condition - benefits must outweigh risks. One patient at Mayo reported pulmonologist suggested moving to yearly check-ups due to stable scans, though patient successfully advocated for maintaining 6-month visits. Another patient with moderate bronchiectasis sees doctor every 6 months but only gets annual CT. If uncomfortable with reduced monitoring frequency, patients can: request more frequent CTs (self-pay option ~$250 for high-resolution CT if insurance won't cover), advocate for maintaining current schedule, or get prescription and schedule independently.

The key principle: minimizing exposure to aerosolized water droplets from showers is the primary prevention goal, regardless of specific alternative washing method chosen. This expert guidance validates: (1) Removing showerheads and using direct pipe flow (sailor's shower - water on only to wet and rinse), (2) Taking baths instead of showers (though still be cautious of aerosols when filling tub or washing hair), (3) Washing hair in sink rather than under shower spray, (4) Any method that reduces time exposed to fine water mist from showerheads. The underlying science: Showerheads create ideal conditions for NTM bacteria to aerosolize and be inhaled deep into lungs, making shower aerosol avoidance more critical than specific bathing alternative. Some patients who had home water tested found it negative for bacteria but still choose bath/alternative methods as precaution - even 'clean' water can harbor NTM in biofilms that testing misses.",

Many GI doctors focus solely on digestive symptoms (heartburn, reflux discomfort) and don't appreciate that silent reflux with no GI symptoms can still cause significant lung damage through aspiration. National Jewish Hospital and other NTM centers have GI specialists on staff who understand this connection and can coordinate with pulmonology team - one advantage of getting comprehensive evaluation at center of excellence.

This is common problem - many GI specialists lack knowledge of aspiration risk in lung disease. Specific doctor recommendations for DC/Maryland area. Important to vet GI doctors for bronchiectasis knowledge before establishing care to avoid inadequate treatment of critical underlying condition."

      "tip": "When choosing local pulmonologist for ongoing NTM/bronchiectasis care (especially if not near major center), key qualities to verify during initial consultation: (1) Orders appropriate monitoring: Regular CT scans (6-month or annual based on stability), PFT testing, sputum cultures with analysis beyond just 'positive/negative' (ideally colony counts, species identification, antibiotic susceptibilities), (2) Recommends evidence-based airway clearance: Prescribes nebulizer with saline (preferably 7%), knows about and endorses Aerobika or similar PEP devices, encourages regular exercise, provides or refers to respiratory therapist for technique training, (3) Responsive communication: Returns phone calls, responds to MyChart/portal messages, available for questions about test results and medication side effects, doesn't dismiss patient concerns, (4) Recognizes expertise limitations: Willing to prescribe treatments when patient requests based on specialist recommendations or community knowledge (like 7% saline, Aerobika), consults with or refers to NTM centers of excellence for complex decisions, doesn't insist they know better than specialists when patient has gotten second opinion, (5) Sees patients at appropriate intervals: Every 4-6 months minimum for active monitoring, more frequently if on treatment or disease progressing. Red flags: Doctor doesn't mention environmental prevention (water, shower risks), never heard of 7% saline or Aerobika, dismisses need for regular sputum cultures, wants to extend visits beyond 6 months when disease not clearly stable, doesn't coordinate with ID specialist for treatment decisions. Even doctors who lack deep NTM prevention knowledge can provide excellent medical care if they order appropriate tests, prescribe evidence-based treatments, and communicate well - patient can supplement with community resources for prevention education. The Dr. Adelman example (Boca Raton) illustrates this: didn't discuss environmental prevention but manages disease well with appropriate monitoring, medication, and responsive care.",

Patient noted he 'never mentioned about boiling water for drinking and equipment and that the shower was a source of NTM' but still rates him highly because he does all the essential medical management well. This distinction is important: local doctors don't need to be environmental prevention experts if they excel at clinical care and are receptive to patient requests. Patients can learn prevention from communities like NTMIR."

      "tip": "Regional specialist availability in South Florida for elderly NTM/bronchiectasis patients: The Delray Beach/Boca Raton area has several pulmonologists with bronchiectasis experience (Dr. Adelman in West Boca, Dr. Kessler at Pulmonary & Sleep Associates in Boca), though some patients travel to Miami area for specialists with deeper expertise (Dr. Lisa Domaradzki at University of Miami - patient drove from Naples, about 2 hours). For patients in their 80s or with mobility limitations, consider: (1) Proximity vs expertise tradeoff: Boca Raton options are closer to Delray Beach but may have less specialized NTM focus; Miami specialists have more bronchiectasis expertise but require longer travel, (2) Initial evaluation at closer location: Start with local Boca pulmonologist for monitoring while arranging evaluation at center of excellence (NJH, Mayo, or Miami specialist) to establish treatment plan that local doctor can implement, (3) Cleveland Clinic presence: Cleveland Clinic in Weston has specialists and may have MAC expertise, could be closer option than Miami depending on location, (4) South Florida has growing number of bronchiectasis patients (aging snowbird population), so specialist availability increasing - check NTMIR physician referral list and Care Center Network for most current options. For very elderly patients (80s), logistical considerations: choosing doctors who take your insurance (verify before scheduling), proximity to reduce travel burden, doctor's communication style (important for patients who may need family involvement), whether practice has experience coordinating with out-of-state specialists if you split care between Florida winter residence and other location.",

      "tip": "When evaluating whether a local pulmonologist is adequate for bronchiectasis management versus traveling to center of excellence, consider this patient-validated criteria checklist: (1) Disease monitoring: Does doctor order CT scans at appropriate intervals (6-month if new/progressing, annual if stable), regular sputum cultures (not just when symptomatic), PFT testing, and actually review/explain results? (2) Airway clearance: Has doctor prescribed nebulizer (preferably with 7% saline), discussed or prescribed airway clearance devices (Aerobika, Acapella, flutter), encouraged exercise, and provided respiratory therapist training or referral? (3) Medication responsiveness: When you request specific treatments based on specialist recommendations or patient community knowledge (7% saline, specific antibiotics), does doctor prescribe them readily or push back? (4) Communication quality: Does doctor return phone calls promptly, respond to portal messages, make time to answer questions, and treat your concerns seriously? (5) Treatment philosophy: For stable patients, does doctor encourage 'living life happily' rather than being consumed by prevention measures, while still maintaining appropriate monitoring? (6) Expertise acknowledgment: Does doctor consult with or refer to specialists when facing complex decisions, or insist they can handle everything themselves? (7) Visit frequency: Sees you every 4-6 months minimum for established patients, more frequently during treatment or if progressing. Patient experience with Dr. Adelman illustrates 'good enough' local care: Sees patients every 4 months, orders regular CT scans, tries to obtain sputum (though acknowledges difficulty), encourages nebulizing 2x daily, encourages exercise, prescribes requested treatments (7% saline, Aerobika) without resistance, nice demeanor, returns calls. Gaps: Didn't educate about environmental prevention (water boiling, shower risks), may not have deep MAC treatment expertise. Verdict: Patient considers him 'the best in Boca for BE' despite prevention education gaps because medical management and communication are excellent. The key insight: Local doctor doesn't need to be perfect or know everything about NTM if they handle the clinical essentials well and you can supplement with online community for prevention education. However, if your local doctor fails multiple items on this checklist (unresponsive, doesn't order appropriate tests, dismisses your questions, resists evidence-based treatments), that's when traveling to center of excellence becomes more critical.",

  "common_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Is it worth traveling to National Jewish Hospital for evaluation if I have a local pulmonologist?",
      "answer": "Many patients find NJH evaluation worthwhile even with competent local care because: (1) NJH does comprehensive testing often missed locally (GERD, CF, genetic predisposition, alpha-1, immune testing), identifying underlying causes that affect treatment, (2) Patient reported NJH discovered likely cystic fibrosis at age 71 which would have remained undiagnosed locally - this explained NTM susceptibility and opened treatment options, (3) NJH evaluation confirms whether local doctor's watchful waiting approach is appropriate vs should start treatment, (4) Creates detailed treatment roadmap that local doctor can implement, (5) Establishes relationship with top specialists for questions/guidance throughout disease course. However, evaluate based on: disease severity (stable vs progressing), insurance coverage (some don't cover out-of-state care), ability to take 1-2 weeks off work, cost tolerance ($1,000+ evaluation plus travel), and whether local doctor recommendations seem uncertain. If disease is stable and local doctor is confident and responsive, you may defer specialist evaluation. If progressing or starting complex treatment (Big 3 antibiotics, IV Amikacin), specialist evaluation becomes more critical."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between National Jewish Hospital and Mayo Clinic for NTM care?",
      "answer": "Both are excellent centers of excellence but differ in approach: National Jewish (Denver) is considered the nation's top NTM/bronchiectasis center with highest patient volume, most comprehensive initial testing (7-10 days covering dozens of tests including GERD, CF, genetic, immune, alpha-1), and long-standing focus on these diseases. Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN only - Mayo Phoenix has no NTM clinic) has strong team approach with pulmonology + infectious disease + pharmacologist working together, Dr. Timothy Aksamit is highly regarded (NTMIR board member), patients praise having pharmacist explain all medications and team always available for questions. Mayo's initial evaluation appears shorter/less extensive than NJH. One Bay Area patient reported going to Mayo after being unimpressed with Stanford and found Mayo 'far superior, really no comparison.' Geographic considerations matter: NJH is closer for Southwest/West Coast patients, Mayo for Midwest, though patients travel from all regions to both. Insurance acceptance differs - some patients report Mayo won't take their insurance while NJH did. Both manage long-distance care through local doctor coordination and remote monitoring. Choice often comes down to: insurance coverage, which doctors you'll see (patients specifically request certain doctors at both centers), and geographic convenience."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I find an NTM specialist near me if I don't live near a major center?",
      "answer": "Use these resources: (1) NTMIR Physician Referral List (ntminfo.org/united-states-of-america/) lists doctors who confirmed familiarity with NTM treatment guidelines - searchable by state, though some states have very few listings (Illinois has few, Indiana had none as of Feb 2025), (2) Care Center Network (bronchiectasisandntminitiative.org/Find-Care) is searchable by city showing established NTM care centers - includes collaborations like Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia which partners with National Jewish, (3) Ask at nearest major academic medical center for pulmonologists with NTM experience - even if not on referral lists, teaching hospitals more likely to have exposure, (4) If your current pulmonologist is knowledgeable about NTM, you can request NTMIR staff reach out to add them to referral list with doctor's consent, (5) Request referral from your general pulmonologist to specialists on these lists. Patient-recommended regional specialists: Greater Philadelphia - Dr. Leah Lande (main line, published NTM researcher), Dr. Conrad Reed (Abington); Tampa area - use Care Center Network to find current options; DMV area - Hopkins Bayview NTM clinic (Fridays), Georgetown Dr. Ann O'Donnell. Many patients drive 3-5 hours to nearest specialist - one patient drives from Louisiana to UT Tyler (5 hours), another from Delaware to Hopkins. If no regional option exists, initial evaluation at center of excellence can establish care plan that local non-specialist pulmonologist implements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I have both a local pulmonologist and see a center of excellence, or choose one?",
      "answer": "Most successful long-distance patients use hybrid approach with both: Center of excellence (NJH, Mayo, UT Tyler) for: initial comprehensive evaluation and testing, treatment plan development, complex decisions (when to start/stop antibiotics, cavity management), periodic monitoring (6-12 month check-ins), access to specialist expertise for questions/issues, staying current on new treatments/medications. Local pulmonologist for: routine monitoring (PFTs, sputum cultures between center visits), prescription implementation and refills, urgent issues and flare-ups, local CT scans and blood work, airway clearance technique training follow-up. This model requires: (1) Local doctor who respects and implements center recommendations (not 'staying in their own lane' and refusing to coordinate), (2) Good communication between local doctor and center - shared records access, willingness to consult on issues, (3) Clear division of responsibilities - who prescribes what, who orders which tests, who patient contacts for different issues, (4) Patient willingness to manage coordination and share information between providers. Centers like NJH explicitly designed for this model - they expect out-of-state patients to have local doctor for implementation while center provides strategic guidance. However, if you live within 1-2 hours of center, you might use them for all care. If local doctor is truly excellent and confident with NTM, center evaluation might be one-time consultation rather than ongoing relationship. Key is having responsive, knowledgeable local doctor - patients with unresponsive local doctors end up struggling with prescription refills, test result questions, and flare-up management even with great center care."
    },
    {
      "question": "My NTM specialist is leaving the practice - should I follow them or stay with the institution?",
      "answer": "When specialist relocates, consider: (1) If they're at Center of Excellence institution (like UT Tyler, NJH, Mayo), strongly consider staying with institution rather than following doctor - one patient whose Dr. McShane left UT Tyler received advice: 'UT Tyler is a center of excellence with long history as TB institution, other outstanding physicians and medical professionals there, respiratory therapists, PFT techs, imaging staff, nurses, pharmacy staff (amazing) all permeated by her expertise and commitment, program has decades of history, you will still be in the best of hands.' Centers have team approach where doctors consult with each other on cases, so institutional knowledge remains even when individual doctor leaves. (2) If doctor moving to different state/distant location, travel logistics become major factor - unless you live closer to new location, following them may not be practical. Dr. McShane moved from Texas to Washington, making travel impossible for Louisiana patients who had driven 5 hours to Tyler. (3) New doctor inheriting patients at established center should maintain continuity of care with access to full medical records and treatment history, though initial visit may involve re-establishing relationship and reviewing treatment plan. (4) If doctor was solo practitioner (not at center of excellence), following them to new location may be worth considering if relocating within reasonable travel distance. (5) Consider using transition as opportunity to evaluate whether center of excellence consultation would benefit your care. For patients who drove long distances (3-5 hours) specifically to see one doctor at center, they are often 'devastated' by loss but find reassurance in institutional strength and team approach at centers of excellence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I expect the first time visiting National Jewish Hospital for evaluation?",
      "answer": "NJH evaluation process: (1) Scheduling: 3.5 months wait time from initial call to visit (as of 2024), scheduler will propose 7-10 day visit window and work around holidays/weekends. You can request shorter visit (5 days) if you've had recent testing locally and are willing to opt out of some tests - discuss with scheduler. They may offer NYC location but Denver is the main program everyone references. (2) Pre-visit: You'll receive detailed schedule well before visit showing all appointments, times, and locations within hospital. Different departments schedule independently so days may be fully booked or have several-hour gaps. (3) Day 1: Meet your pulmonologist who reviews your case, confirms or modifies testing schedule based on your situation. Also meet infectious disease doctor. (4) Days 2-6: Testing phase includes some/all depending on your case: CT scan, PFT testing (lung function), bronchoscopy with BAL if needed, GERD testing (often two different tests), alpha-1 testing, cystic fibrosis screening (genetic panel), rheumatoid arthritis testing, hearing and eye exams, blood work panel (47+ tests), airway clearance training with respiratory therapists (includes nebulizer technique, Aerobika, vest therapy), nutritional counseling if weight is concern. Testing runs roughly 8am-5pm weekdays, not all days fully scheduled. (5) Final day: Meet with pulmonologist and ID doctor to review all results and receive treatment recommendations. You'll leave with: nebulizer prescription (can purchase at NJH pharmacy and travel home with it ~8 lbs), airway clearance device prescriptions, detailed treatment plan, follow-up schedule (usually 6 months). (6) Surprises reported by patients: Volume and variety of testing ('tested for everything'), discovering unexpected conditions like CF at age 71, some test results explained as 'too technical' to discuss until follow-up, confusion when 3 different respiratory therapists gave different airway clearance instructions. (7) Logistics: Stay at nearby hotel (Residence Inn Cherry Creek popular - has kitchen, 10-minute Uber), don't need rental car (Uber/Lyft reliable), budget $1,000+ out-pocket even with insurance, 1-2 weeks away from home depending on visit length and testing schedule."
