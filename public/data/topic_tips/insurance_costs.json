    "Medicare Part D 2025 $2,000 annual out-of-pocket cap is game-changer for NTM patients - makes drugs costing $88,000-180,000 annually actually affordable, but must verify drugs are on plan's formulary",
    "Insurance navigation requires active self-advocacy - calling insurance directly, comparing multiple discount cards, filing appeals with detailed medical documentation, and switching plans during open enrollment often necessary to access needed care",
    "Discount cards (GoodRx, AARP) critical cost-savings tool for non-covered medications like 7% saline - can reduce costs 60-80%, but prices vary wildly by pharmacy/region and pharmacies can check multiple cards to find best price",
    "DME companies profit from rentals over purchases - independently verify with insurance whether rental required, as companies misrepresent requirements; outright purchase often cheaper long-term than rental payments",
    "Out-of-network specialist access depends on insurance type - Kaiser HMO won't refer out even without expertise (forcing self-pay), while PPO plans more likely to approve appeals with proper documentation of lack of in-network alternatives",
    "Medicare Part D formularies vary dramatically by state and carrier, change annually, and don't always make logical sense (cheaper drugs drop while expensive added) - must research during EVERY open enrollment with current+projected drug list",

      "question": "How much does Arikayce actually cost patients out-of-pocket?",
      "answer": "Retail cost exceeds $180,000/year, but actual patient costs vary widely. With insurance coverage, most pay copays. Insmed offers patient assistance programs - patients report filling out forms and getting approved to reduce costs. Starting 2025, Medicare Part D $2,000 annual cap limits out-of-pocket for all covered prescriptions, making Arikayce much more affordable if on formulary."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I find Medicare Part D plan that covers my NTM medications?",
      "answer": "Use Medicare.gov Plan Compare tool during open enrollment (ends Dec 7). Enter ALL current medications PLUS drugs you might need in coming year (ask doctor). Include dosages and quantities. Tool shows which plans cover what at which pharmacies. Consider contacting independent Medicare agent or state SHIP office for unbiased help - they can enter meds into their systems and find best match. Plan D formularies vary by state."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Medicare Plan D and Plan G?",
      "answer": "Plan G is Medicare supplement (covers medical costs like copays, coinsurance) - most comprehensive supplement available. Plan D is prescription drug coverage (separate). Both needed for complete coverage. Important: Get Plan G when first Medicare-eligible (no health questions), as switching later requires medical underwriting which may deny with NTM diagnosis."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I reduce cost of 7% hypertonic saline?",
      "answer": "7% saline typically NOT covered by Medicare Part D. Use discount cards: GoodRx or AARP Prescription Discount (free with AARP membership). Actual costs: $18-28 for 60-90 days depending on pharmacy and card. Ask pharmacy to check multiple discount cards to find best price. CVS, Walgreens, RiteAid all accept cards but prices vary by region. Cannot combine discount card with insurance - use whichever gives better price."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will insurance cover out-of-network NTM specialist?",
      "answer": "Depends on insurance type. PPO plans more likely to approve with proper appeals showing no in-network specialist available + detailed doctor letters documenting medical necessity. Kaiser HMO specifically will NOT refer out even when lacking expertise - forces self-pay for National Jewish or other specialists. One patient upgraded from EPO to PPO during open enrollment to get out-of-network coverage. File formal appeals with multiple physician letters for best chance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I rent or buy an airway clearance vest?",
      "answer": "Call insurance directly to verify whether rental required - DME companies profit from rentals and may misrepresent requirements. Example: Company wanted $300-1,000/month rental (totaling far more than purchase), but insurance would actually cover purchase. Outright vest purchase ~$1,200. SmartVest and Hill Rom offer patient assistance programs. Get list of in-network DME companies from insurance and compare."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if insurance denies my expensive NTM medication?",
      "answer": "Multiple strategies: (1) File appeals with updated clinical documentation - multiple appeals with different justifications can succeed, (2) Have doctor submit medical necessity letters explaining why drug critical, (3) Contact drug manufacturer for patient assistance program (separate from insurance), (4) Switch to different Plan D or PPO plan during next open enrollment that covers the drug, (5) For Medicare: starting 2025, $2,000 annual cap makes even denied-then-approved drugs affordable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do GoodRx and AARP discount cards work?",
      "answer": "Both provide discounts for non-covered medications - cannot be combined with insurance. Use whichever gives better price for specific drug at specific pharmacy. AARP card free with membership ($12-16/year). Many pharmacies (CVS especially) have multiple cards on file and will automatically check which gives best price. Prices vary wildly by region and pharmacy chain. Some Walgreens refusing GoodRx due to 'fraud policy' - try different location."
