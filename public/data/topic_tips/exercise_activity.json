Many former lap swimmers now limit themselves to shallow water near the pool edge with just a few safe strokes.

Don't normalize prolonged symptoms\u2014your regimen should manage exercise-related bronchospasm effectively.

Dr. Noah Greenspan's 'Ultimate Pulmonary Wellness' book discusses breathlessness and exercise extensively.

These are specifically designed for obstructive lung disease, not generic fitness programs."

Middle-ground options: home gym with streaming classes, outdoor activities (walking, biking, pickleball), gym attendance with strict precautions (avoid water features/peak hours, hand hygiene, masking if others symptomatic), standing in back of classes.
