Strategies: Share NTMir free patient booklet with family (mailed or PDF), explain in simple terms ('I avoid tap water because it has pathogens almost everyone can tolerate but I'm one of the unlucky few who can't'), bring spouse/family to specialist appointments, join support groups for validation from others who understand. One family learned seriousness when they googled MAC life expectancy. Another patient found psychologist specializing in chronic illness most helpful one-on-one.",

One patient's husband supportive but others report spouses dismissive ('just take the drugs'), refusing to help with care, not believing disease is serious.

One patient diagnosed 2019 training for rim-to-rim Grand Canyon completed 245 miles of Appalachian Trail during 2020 antibiotic treatment, later finished AT and continues 6-week hiking trips.

Dr. Haas at National Jewish: 'Don't become the bubble boy.' Dr. Falkinham's practical formula: exposure risk = (NTM concentration) \u00d7 (duration). Focus on high-concentration/long-duration exposures (showers with 0.2 micron filter, N95 for potting soil/dusty roads, avoid indoor aerosols/estuaries/waterfalls). Many pulmonologists think support group prevention measures are 'crazy' - one said 'nothing inside your house you wouldn't be exposed to outside.'

Positive experiences: Many patients report NO side effects or minimal issues (orange urine funny, slight tooth discoloration fixed with hydrogen peroxide rinse, tiredness/itchy skin manageable). Tips for starting: get baseline labs/hearing/eye exams, ask doctor for Zofran (ondansetron 4mg dissolvable) prescription for nausea before starting (don't wait for problems), take meds at night before bed, consider starting one-at-a-time to identify side effects, keep detailed log.

Common temporary issues: stomach pain/gas/rumbling (GI system resetting), tinnitus and neuropathy may persist longer or permanently. Positive changes: feeling much better, more energy, friends/family notice improvement. Some patients notice NO change positive or negative. Tip: Patients with 'extra weight' may tolerate antibiotics better than thin patients. After stopping, increase airway clearance intensity (2 vials saline daily instead of 1, invest in eRapid nebulizer, continue daily exercise) and watch for any negative changes requiring medical attention.",

Anonymity valid for privacy, vulnerability, avoiding prejudice about chronic illness. Posting anonymously doesn't reduce credibility - medical information extremely personal (HIPAA laws).

Check oxygen levels with pulse oximeter ($40 NuvoMed recommended). Breathlessness from MAC/BE: may indicate pseudomonas needing treatment, heart issues (aortic stenosis), or disease progression. Use maintenance inhalers (Spiriva, Wixela, Trelegy) to keep airways open. Exertion episode: woman swam in rough water, couldn't breathe in afterward, blue lips, took 4 hours + nebulizer to recover.

If small amount blood, continue saline; if larger amount, skip day of saline but continue postural drainage. Mix 3% and 7% for tolerance.

Side effects harsh: dark tan skin, eye color change, orange tears/urine, permanent hearing loss from amikacin. Success rate low ('abysmal') but some clear then reinfect years later.
