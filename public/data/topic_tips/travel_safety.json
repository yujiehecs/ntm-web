  "key_insights": [
    "Water safety is paramount - bottled spring water (Dr. Falkinham tested), LifeStraw 0.2μm filters (validated by Dr. Falkinham), and UV bottles (LARQ 3-min adventure mode) are three proven safe options for drinking water while traveling",
    "Equipment sterilization requires advance planning based on destination - Baby Brezza works in US/Canada only, Drizzle pot (dual voltage) for Europe, LifeStraw pitcher for cruises, Medela steam bags for microwaves, or pre-sterilized disposables as backup",
    "Cruise ships present unique challenges - no heat sources in rooms, equipment often confiscated, but LifeStraw pitcher and advance permission for spring water (with doctor's letter) can work around restrictions",
    "Geographic risk assessment critical - humid tropical estuaries (Vietnam/Cambodia rivers) extremely high risk requiring constant N95 masking, while dry season visits (January-February) much safer; Rocky Mountain dusty roads also high risk",
    "UV water sterilization has critical limitation - photoreactivation occurs when UV-treated water exposed to any light, allowing NTM to repair and regrow; must drink directly from opaque UV bottle, never transfer to clear glass",
    "International travel requires equipment redundancy - carry spare mesh nebulizer, extra filters, pre-boiled distilled water, collapsible equipment for soaking/boiling, and verify Baby Brezza won't work outside US/Canada despite voltage converters",
    "High altitude significantly impacts lung function - oxygen saturations can drop into 80s or 70s during sleep at 7,000+ feet; HAST testing before trip determines if supplemental oxygen needed"

  "common_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What water is safe to drink while traveling?",
      "answer": "Bottled spring water is safest (fewest NTM per Dr. Falkinham's lab testing). Alternatively, use LifeStraw bottle with 0.2 micrometer filter to make any water safe, or LARQ UV bottle on 3-minute adventure mode (must keep in dark after treatment to prevent NTM photoreactivation). Pasteurization does NOT kill NTM, so pasteurized juices/milk still contain NTM."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is cruise travel safe with NTM disease?",
      "answer": "Cruise travel possible but requires careful planning. Major challenges: (1) Legionella risk from HVAC systems, (2) No microwaves or heat sources in rooms, (3) Hot pots/kettles often confiscated. Solutions: LifeStraw pitcher for all water needs, contact special accommodations for permission to bring spring water with doctor's letter, or risk hiding Drizzle pot in drawer. Consider Legionella exposure risk from humidification systems when deciding if cruise worth it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I sterilize equipment while traveling?",
      "answer": "Best options by location: (1) US/Canada hotels - Baby Brezza travel sterilizer, (2) Europe - Drizzle pot dual voltage (Baby Brezza does NOT work despite converters), (3) Cruises - LifeStraw pitcher + Medela steam bags if microwave available, (4) Anywhere - carry pre-boiled distilled water for multiple boiling cycles, collapsible bowl for Dawn soaking, (5) Backup plan - pre-sterilize disposable neb cups with alcohol soak before trip."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I travel to humid tropical destinations like Vietnam or Southeast Asia?",
      "answer": "Extremely high risk - Dr. Falkinham states 'lots of aerosolized NTM' in humid estuary-rich regions and recommends wearing N95 mask 'all the time.' He acknowledged 'no easy solution to avoid NTM in aerosols in humid tropical regions.' If going anyway, visit during dry season (January-February in Cambodia) when humidity low and mask only at riverside. River cruises particularly high risk."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use my Baby Brezza sterilizer in Europe?",
      "answer": "No - multiple patients confirmed Baby Brezza does NOT work in Europe even with voltage converter. Manufacturer states use only in US/Canada and will void warranty if used elsewhere. Use Drizzle pot (dual voltage) for Europe instead, or find microwaves for Medela steam bags."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will TSA give me trouble with my nebulizer equipment?",
      "answer": "No - TSA familiar with nebulizers as of 2023-2025, no doctor's note required (though can be helpful). Medical equipment in bag with medical luggage tags does NOT count toward carry-on limit when disclosed to gate crew. Nebulizers exempt from 3-1-1 liquids rule. TSA Cares available for advance coordination if concerned."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is high altitude dangerous with MAC/bronchiectasis?",
      "answer": "Can be significant issue - oxygen saturations may drop into 80s or even 70s during sleep at 7,000+ feet elevation. Get HAST (High Altitude Simulation Test) before trip to determine if need supplemental oxygen. Even if pass test, portable oxygen concentrator (purse-sized) helpful for energy throughout day. Some patients feel exhausted entire trip at altitude."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are dusty roads dangerous for NTM exposure?",
      "answer": "Rocky Mountain dusty roads pose risk - pine-rich, peat moss-rich soils are preferred NTM habitat per Dr. Falkinham. Keep car windows closed and use recirculating air (not fresh air intake) on dusty roads. Change cabin air filters every 2 months when traveling in dusty areas. Desert dusty trails also concerning for hiking."
