  "key_insights": [
    "Saline concentration is customizable - mixing 3% and 7% allows individual tolerance optimization without new prescriptions",
    "Blood-tinged sputum during airway clearance is common with bronchiectasis but requires temporary ACT cessation to allow healing",
    "Albuterol benefit should be verified with PFT testing - many patients nebulize it unnecessarily without bronchospasm",
    "Levalbuterol reduces jitteriness for many but not all patients - inhaler puffs or alternative bronchodilators (DuoNeb, Atrovent) are other options",
    "2x daily airway clearance is preventative and curative - continue even when not producing sputum, especially after antibiotics temporarily dry secretions",
    "Homemade saline carries significant contamination risk - commercial sterile vials strongly preferred despite cost",
    "Sore throat from saline is manageable with warm salt water gargles, Manuka honey, mouth rinsing, and concentration adjustment",
    "Nebulizer plastic safety concerns are minimal with proper replacement schedules (3-6 months) - medical-grade materials tested for heat exposure",
    "7% saline can be too harsh for some patients - 3% or mixed concentrations equally effective for many without irritation",
    "Timing matters: spread ACT sessions throughout day (morning before eating, evening before dinner/bedtime) for optimal effectiveness",
    "GERD patients should evaluate albuterol carefully - may worsen reflux by relaxing lower esophageal sphincter",
    "Seasonal factors affect tolerance - dry winter air exacerbates saline irritation, requiring concentration adjustments or increased hydration",
    "Exercise synergizes with saline therapy - physical activity mobilizes mucus that saline has hydrated for easier expectoration",
    "Recent research questions saline for exacerbation prevention, but individual patient experiences vary - discuss with doctor before stopping",
    "Opened saline vials should be discarded after single use per clinical guidelines - reuse protocols exist but carry infection risk"

  "common_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Should I start with 3% or 7% hypertonic saline?",
      "answer": "Start with 3% if you're new to hypertonic saline nebulization. It causes less throat irritation and coughing while still providing effective mucus hydration. You can increase to 7% later if tolerated, or mix concentrations (2ml of 3% + 2ml of 7% = 5%) to find your optimal balance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do I get a sore throat after nebulizing saline?",
      "answer": "Hypertonic saline can irritate throat tissue, especially 7% concentration or during dry winter months. Solutions: gargle with warm salt water after nebulizing, try Manuka honey before/after, rinse mouth to remove salt residue, reduce to 3% or mixed concentration, drink warm tea before ACT, and ensure adequate hydration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I save opened saline vials to use later and save money?",
      "answer": "Standard clinical guidance is to discard opened vials after single use due to bacterial contamination risk. Some patients reuse within 24 hours with careful sterile handling (don't touch tip, store upright in clean covered container), but this carries infection risk for immunocompromised lungs. Most doctors recommend discarding for safety."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it safe to make my own saline solution to save money?",
      "answer": "National Jewish Health and most pulmonologists advise against homemade saline due to contamination risk. Even with boiling, solution is not sterile after 24 hours. If your doctor specifically prescribes homemade protocol: use distilled water boiled 10 min, sterilize glass storage bottle by boiling 10 min, remake weekly, and microwave 2 min before each use. Commercial sterile vials strongly preferred."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I worry about inhaling microplastics from nebulizer cups?",
      "answer": "Medical-grade nebulizer plastics are tested for safety with heat exposure. Plastics break down very slowly (months in ocean environment) - your 3-6 month nebulizer replacement schedule prevents significant degradation. Follow manufacturer's steam sterilization guidelines (don't boil plastic parts) and replace equipment regularly per specifications."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I do if I cough up blood during airway clearance?",
      "answer": "Small streaks of blood (blood-tinged sputum) are common with bronchiectasis and don't require ER visit. However: stop all airway clearance for 1-2 days to let lungs heal, reduce saline concentration from 7% to 3%, avoid aggressive coughing, and contact doctor if bleeding exceeds 1/2 cup or bright red blood persists."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to nebulize albuterol before saline?",
      "answer": "Only if you have asthma or bronchospasm. Ask for Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) without albuterol and with albuterol - if no significant improvement, you don't need it. If albuterol helps but causes jitteriness, try levalbuterol (Xopenex), DuoNeb, Atrovent, or inhaler puffs instead of nebulized form."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does albuterol make me so jittery and shaky?",
      "answer": "Albuterol is a stimulant bronchodilator that can increase heart rate and cause tremors. Solutions: switch to levalbuterol (fewer cardiac effects for many), try DuoNeb or Atrovent (different mechanism), use inhaler puffs before nebulizing instead of nebulized form, or verify via PFT if you actually need bronchodilator at all."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I continue airway clearance 2x daily even when I'm not coughing anything up?",
      "answer": "Yes - \"twice daily is the gold standard, in sickness and in health.\" Airway clearance is both preventative and curative. After antibiotics, sputum production decreases temporarily as medications dry out mucus, but bacteria remains. Continue 2x daily ACT to prevent reinfection and maintain lung health."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best time of day to do airway clearance with saline?",
      "answer": "Most effective to spread throughout day: first thing in morning before eating (often most productive session), then again before dinner or bedtime. Avoid back-to-back sessions. Some find post-breakfast most productive, others prefer right before bed. Whatever schedule you'll actually stick with consistently is best."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does research support nebulizing saline for NTM and bronchiectasis?",
      "answer": "2025 NEJM study questioned mucoactive agents for bronchiectasis exacerbation prevention (not NTM-specific). Small NTM study (100 people, 3 months) currently enrolling. Despite research questions, many patients report feeling worse without saline. Individual response varies - discuss with your doctor before stopping established routine."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can albuterol worsen my acid reflux/GERD?",
      "answer": "Yes - albuterol may relax lower esophageal sphincter, potentially worsening GERD (Dr. Edward Chan, National Jewish Health). If you have reflux issues and PFT shows albuterol doesn't significantly improve lung function, discuss with doctor whether to continue it. Risk vs. benefit assessment needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I nebulize saline while using my Vest or SmartVest?",
      "answer": "Yes - many nebulize during vest therapy to save time. Levalbuterol then 7% saline while vest shakes (30 min total), then Aerobika 30 min later. Benefit: vest shaking helps distribute medication and also disperses jittery side effects from bronchodilators faster."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does exercise fit with saline nebulization?",
      "answer": "Exercise mobilizes mucus that saline has hydrated. Optimal sequence: nebulize bronchodilator (if needed), exercise 30-40 min to loosen secretions, then nebulize saline with Aerobika/vest. Keep water or discreet container handy during swimming, walking, floor exercises for expectoration."
    },
    {
      "question": "My doctor says I can't take albuterol every day - is this correct?",
      "answer": "Many patients safely nebulize albuterol 2x daily for years with proper monitoring. Prescriptions often written \"up to 4 times daily.\" If your doctor says daily use not allowed, seek second opinion from pulmonologist specializing in bronchiectasis/NTM. Albuterol daily use is standard care for many patients with airway disease."
