      "question": "Do I need to soak equipment in Dawn before boiling?",

    {
      "question": "How often should I sterilize?",
      "answer": "Standard recommendation is daily washing with weekly sterilization (from NTM conference Berkeley). However, successful long-term patients show range works: Sue does weekly when healthy/daily when sick (5 years no exacerbations), while Debbie focuses on daily airway clearance over perfect sterilization (10 years exacerbation-free)."

    {
      "question": "Which baby bottle sterilizer is best?",
      "answer": "Dr. Jennifer Honda's 2023 testing validated Bololo, Baby Brezza, Grownsy, and Philips Avent. Bololo is most popular in community. Key is reaching 100°C/212°F for 15+ minutes. One user measured Philips Avent at insufficient 93.5°C - verify your specific model's temperature."

    {
      "question": "Is distilled water safe for nasal rinses?",
      "answer": "NO - dangerous misconception. Dr. Falkinham's lab found NTM in distilled and 'purified' grocery store water. Must boil 10 minutes first. Bottled spring water (Crystal Geyser, Nestle Pure Life) tested safer but boiling is most reliable."

    {
      "question": "Can I use vinegar to sterilize?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Are UV sterilizers effective?",
      "answer": "NO for practical use. UV requires 3-4 hours direct exposure to kill 99.9% of NTM unless using extremely powerful lamps. UV entry-point systems for plumbing don't address existing biofilms on pipes. UV toothbrush cases unlikely effective given time requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is tap water safe for rinsing if I sterilize afterward?",
      "answer": "YES - Dr. Falkinham confirmed that sterilization step kills any NTM from tap rinse. This makes equipment sterilization much more affordable since you don't need sterile water for every rinse. Still use sterile water for final rinse before use without sterilization."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do microwave steam bags work for NTM?",
      "answer": "UNCERTAIN - Medela bags say 3-5 minutes based on wattage, but NTM standard is 10 minutes boiling. Some theorize pressure creates higher temps, but Dr. Falkinham hasn't validated this. OK for short-term travel when better options unavailable, but not ideal for daily use."
