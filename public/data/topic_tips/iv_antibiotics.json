  "key_insights": [
    "Abscessus is non-negotiable IV territory: Unlike MAC which can sometimes be watched or treated with oral-only regimens, abscessus subspecies (especially erm41) requires initial IV intensive phase. This is the #1 use case for IV antibiotics in NTM - watch-and-wait only applies to truly asymptomatic low-colony-count cases under expert supervision.",
    "Hearing loss prevention is critical-level monitoring: IV Amikacin ototoxicity is PERMANENT and can progress to complete deafness. Baseline + monthly audiograms are non-negotiable. Some patients lost 70-100% hearing in one or both ears. This makes IV Amikacin high-stakes compared to inhaled formulations.",
    "PICC lines are less limiting than feared: Patients successfully do line dancing, weight lifting, hiking, biking, aerobics with PICC in place using protective sleeve. Main restriction is water activities. Fresh IV 3x/week is alternative for those who can't tolerate PICC (Ehlers-Danlos, difficult veins).",
    "Plain inhaled Amikacin beats expensive Arikayce for sensitive patients: Generic Amikacin mixed with 3% saline in nebulizer costs $7/month vs $$$ for Arikayce, avoids Arikayce's 'inert' ingredients causing side effects, and is equally effective. Self-described 'side effect queen' had zero issues with plain version after Arikayce made her 'deathly ill.'",
    "Nausea is mostly from ORAL meds, not IV/inhaled Amikacin: Clofazimine, Nuzyra (Omadacycline), Linezolid cause the brutal nausea. Doctors may pause oral meds temporarily to stabilize weight while continuing inhaled Amikacin. Proactive Zofran 1 hour before Nuzyra is game-changer.",
    "Abscessus treatment is a marathon but doable: 14-18 months total (initial IV phase + long oral continuation). Patients successfully travel internationally, swim 3km 5x/week, work during treatment. One 91-year-old remains MAC-free since 2006 with 'off the chart' breathing tests.",
    "Home IV administration works even in rural areas: No infusion center nearby? Nurses coach patients/spouses to administer IV Amikacin at home. Ball-form Amikacin makes this feasible. Critical to get written instructions and reliable nurse phone number.",
    "Infusion rate adjustment solves paresthesia: Tingling/pins-and-needles in hands/feet during IV Amikacin is dose rate issue, not drug intolerance. Slowing infusion from 30 min to 1 hour eliminates tingling completely - don't quit treatment over this.",
    "Extrapulmonary NTM is different beast: Joint infections (MAC in shoulder) need multiple debridement surgeries + IV antibiotics. Skin/soft tissue NTM (chelonae) high-risk with immunosuppression. Don't assume pulmonary NTM protocols apply - needs specialist imaging and aggressive approach.",
    "Fatigue from IV Amikacin persists throughout treatment: Extreme tiredness making driving difficult, requiring afternoon naps, incompatible with full-time work for many patients. This doesn't improve with adaptation over months - it's physiological response that resolves when treatment stops."

  "common_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Do I really need IV antibiotics for abscessus or can I just do oral meds?",
      "answer": "Abscessus requires IV intensive phase (8-12 weeks minimum) followed by oral continuation. Oral-only treatment is insufficient for this highly resistant species. Only exception: truly asymptomatic low-colony-count cases under expert care (like NJH) where watch-and-wait with aggressive airway clearance may clear infection naturally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I go deaf from IV Amikacin?",
      "answer": "Hearing loss is significant risk but not universal. INSIST on baseline audiogram before starting and monthly hearing tests during treatment. Some patients have zero hearing issues, others lose 70-100% hearing permanently. Early detection allows stopping Amikacin before complete deafness."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I still exercise with a PICC line in my arm?",
      "answer": "Yes! Patients do line dancing, weight lifting, hiking, biking, rowing with PICC line + protective sleeve. Only restriction: NO water activities (swimming, hot tubs). If you absolutely need to lift heavy or have hypermobile joints, discuss fresh IV 3x/week or intramuscular injections as alternatives."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I shower with a PICC line?",
      "answer": "Use plastic shower sleeve from Amazon to keep PICC insertion site dry. Take quick showers. No baths, swimming, or soaking. On non-infusion days, you must flush PICC line with heparin - nurses show you how."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use expensive Arikayce or plain generic Amikacin for inhaling?",
      "answer": "If you're sensitive to medications, try plain generic Amikacin mixed with 3% saline in nebulizer FIRST before spending $$$ on Arikayce. Costs ~$7/month copay, equally effective, and avoids Arikayce's extra ingredients. Some patients tolerate plain version perfectly after Arikayce made them deathly ill."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why am I SO nauseous on abscessus treatment - is it the IV Amikacin?",
      "answer": "Nausea is mostly from ORAL medications (Clofazimine, Nuzyra/Omadacycline, Linezolid), NOT from inhaled/IV Amikacin. Take Zofran 1 hour BEFORE your worst offender (usually Nuzyra). Try Nuzyra with crackers, stay upright after dosing. Ginger chews (Gin-Gins brand) help. Your doctor may pause oral meds temporarily while continuing inhaled Amikacin to stabilize weight."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I administer IV Amikacin at home if there's no infusion center near me?",
      "answer": "Yes! Many patients in rural areas successfully do home IV administration. Nurses will coach you and your spouse/caregiver thoroughly. Amikacin comes in ball form that's easier to use than traditional IV bags. Get written instructions and reliable nurse phone number before starting."
    },
    {
      "question": "My hands and feet tingle during IV Amikacin infusions - do I need to stop?",
      "answer": "NO! This is infusion rate issue, not drug intolerance. Ask nurse to slow infusion from 30 minutes to 1 hour. Tingling should disappear completely. Don't quit treatment over this - it's easily fixable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How tired will I be on IV Amikacin?",
      "answer": "Fatigue is significant and real. Many patients can't drive safely after infusions, need afternoon naps, find full-time work very difficult. This doesn't improve over months - it's physiological response lasting throughout treatment. Plan work accommodations or medical leave if needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do I need IV antibiotics for abscessus?",
      "answer": "Typical intensive phase: 8-12 weeks IV (some patients 14+ weeks), then 12-18 months oral continuation therapy. Total treatment often 14-18 months. If you cannot tolerate full intensive phase (hearing loss, severe side effects), work with expert to adjust - some patients successfully treated with shorter IV phase."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my abscessus comes back after I was successfully treated?",
      "answer": "Recurrence/reinfection rate is ~50%. If you're asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, you can delay retreatment - one patient waited 6 years before repeating brutal regimen. Balance quality of life with risk of progression. Key factors: previous treatment side effects (hearing loss), current symptoms, colony count."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is diarrhea so bad on IV antibiotics and what helps?",
      "answer": "Antibiotic-associated diarrhea from heavy IV regimens is common. Use Banatrol + Florastor probiotics, rotate multiple strains, drink kefir. Take probiotics mid-day AWAY from antibiotics (not same time). Psyllium husk works for severe cases. Stay hydrated."
