  "common_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What's the best portable nebulizer for travel?",
      "answer": "Pari Trek S is the overwhelming community favorite—lightweight (especially without battery), reliable with 3-year warranty and excellent Pari customer service (replaces within 1-2 days if under warranty). Battery provides ~40 minutes (one treatment) but outlets usually available so battery often unnecessary. CRITICAL: carry spare Pari Trek compressor (without battery) in checked bag as backup. Jane Hascall learned this hard way after compressor blew out in Italy—now splits spare between carry-on and checked. Gloria Demby's lasted 4 years with 6 weeks/year travel. Pari eFlow mesh nebulizer alternative but expensive ($500+), faster treatments, no spare needed per some users but others prefer redundancy. Works with currency adapters internationally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use disposable nebulizer cups while traveling?",
      "answer": "Depends on sterilization burden vs cost trade-off. PROs: eliminate daily sterilizing hassle, pre-sterilized sealed bags from hospital suppliers ready-to-use (Save Rite Medical, box of 50), use with standard wing-tip tubing on Pari Trek. CONs: Aerobika/OPEP devices still require daily sterilization (so not eliminating sterilizing entirely), SOME disposables marked 'not sterile' requiring pre-boiling (defeats purpose), cost vs reusable if you're boiling anyway. Check packaging carefully—hospital supplier sealed bags truly sterile per RT, but many brands require sterilizing. Good option for 1-2 week trips where eliminating neb cup sterilizing reduces burden even if still sterilizing Aerobika."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I sterilize equipment on cruises where hot plates are prohibited?",
      "answer": "Multiple workarounds: (1) Electric tea kettle + Evenflo microwavable pouch—boil water in kettle, pour over parts in pouch, 5 min sit (Julia Venuti cruise method), (2) Request butler-supplied bottled water cases for soak/rinse (cruises provide bottled water freely), (3) Baby Brezza travel sterilizer if cabin has outlet (most do), (4) Medela Quick Clean microwave steam bags if cabin has microwave (rare but some suites), (5) For short cruises: batch-sterilize multiple sets before departure, store in ziplock, use clean set each treatment. Some patients sterilize every 2-3 days while traveling rather than daily. Holland America offers bathtubs in cabins (not just showers) per Maire Ahern—consider cruise line selection for bathroom facilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the most effective portable sterilization method that's scientifically proven?",
      "answer": "Baby bottle steam sterilizers (Bololo, Philips Avent, Grownsy, Wabi) scientifically validated—Dr. Honda research (2023 patient conference) showed steam disinfection eradicated ALL organisms including 6 NTM strains + 80 CF pathogens from toothbrushes. Yale New Haven Hospital lab supervisor tested by piling devices messily (mimicking real user behavior)—still 100% effective. Bololo uses 150ml water, 15-min steam (~13 min actual boiling), 45-min dry, largest capacity but bulky for travel. Baby Brezza Compact travel version smaller (65% size reduction) but only 10-min steam cycle (some question adequacy vs 12-15 min boiling standard). Microwave steam bags also proven effective but NO metal parts allowed (Arikayce handset, some Aerobikas have metal). Store sterilized equipment bone-dry in sealed ziplock—stays sterile indefinitely per Dr. Falkinham until contacts water/dust."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I get my airway clearance equipment through airport security without it counting as baggage?",
      "answer": "Medical equipment typically doesn't count toward baggage limits with proper documentation: (1) Purchase RED medical luggage tags (Amazon) and attach to equipment bags, (2) Get doctor's letter stating equipment 'medically necessary,' (3) Remove batteries from all devices before TSA, (4) Allow extra time for TSA inspection (they may inspect thoroughly), (5) Split equipment between carry-on and checked bags (one roller bag + bag sitting on top typical). Emily Markavage: 'Medical equipment does NOT count as luggage, tags really saved me.' Inga B: never had problems with medical tags + letter. Most airlines honor exemption but policies vary—call airline beforehand to confirm. TSA permits FROZEN distilled water (1-2 liters) in carry-on if solid frozen—inspect frozen state, then pass through."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I bring distilled water through airport security for sterilizing?",
      "answer": "Yes, if FROZEN SOLID in carry-on—TSA allows frozen liquids. Laura Pearson method: freeze 2 liter bottles distilled water, carry frozen in backpack—TSA inspected, saw frozen, approved passage. Once through security, thaws for use. Laurie Eagle confirmed twice: TSA pulled aside, checked frozen bottles, let through. For checked bags: divide distilled gallon jugs into smaller heavy-duty spring water bottles (1 liter each), place one per checked bag to distribute weight. Some patients also request doctor's letter explaining medical need for distilled water. Alternative: Mexico supermercados sell 'sterile water in sealed containers' by baby formula (1-liter bottles), or find distilled water at auto parts stores abroad (pharmacy/grocery may leave residue)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my US electrical equipment work in Mexico/Canada/internationally?",
      "answer": "Mexico + Canada YES (same ~120V as US, maybe plug adapter needed)—Lisa Britt lived Mexico 4 years, all US appliances worked fine. Baby Brezza warranty says 'US and Canada only' but 127V Mexico voltage effectively compatible despite company providing no guidance. Japan 100V RISKY—close to 120V but may damage devices over time. Europe/Asia/Australia/UK 220-240V REQUIRES CONVERTER (not just plug adapter)—voltage difference too large, will damage device without proper voltage converter. Check device specifications before international travel. When in doubt, contact manufacturer (though Baby Brezza customer service unhelpful about Mexico). Backup plan: boil with hot pot purchased locally (universal method), or microwave steam bags if microwave available."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does sterilized equipment stay sterile in storage?",
      "answer": "INDEFINITELY if stored properly per Dr. Falkinham (2023): 'If something has been sterilized, it will remain sterile unless it comes in contact with water or dust. After sterilized, put in plastic sealable bag, seal it up and leave in cabinet. We sterilize bottles, swabs and lots in my lab and they remain sterile for YEARS.' Key: equipment must be BONE DRY before sealing—any moisture allows bacterial growth. K Richardson stores 4 sets in ziplock over week—fine as long as dry. Linda Esposito runs Bololo dry cycle twice to ensure complete drying, some leave devices to air dry overnight before sealing. Patients batch-sterilize multiple sets before travel, store in individual ziplock bags, use clean set each treatment. Patricia Ponte leaves sterilized equipment in Bololo between uses (many sterilizers have keep-dry mode)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the cheapest way to mail sputum samples to NJH?",
      "answer": "USPS offers range of options: (1) Regular Priority Mail $10 takes 2-3 days (acceptable—NJH accepts up to 4-5 days post-collection per Debbie Breslawsky/Sunny Duncanson), send Monday for weekend buffer, (2) Priority Mail Express overnight $28-42 most states (flat rate $28.75 per Carmen Barrera), (3) If arrives LATE get FULL REFUND—track delivery, file online refund claim (Sunny got refunded twice, Anonymous got postal money order refund). Must use NJH-provided 'Biological Material' envelope (required visible, meets postal regulations). Tell USPS clerk contents for accurate form completion—never issues per multiple patients. FedEx/UPS $100+ and most local stores REFUSE without prepaid label (hazardous materials policy). Cleveland Clinic provides prepaid FedEx return labels (Evan Petee pays $0) but NJH doesn't offer this."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to sterilize equipment daily while traveling or can I do it less often?",
      "answer": "Varies by patient comfort level and medical guidance—no definitive consensus. Conservative approach: daily sterilizing even while traveling (matches home routine, maximum safety). Practical approach embraced by some: every 2-3 days while traveling, especially if short trip (Carolyn Chamberlain: 'doesn't sterilize every day, so far so good'). Factors supporting less frequent: (1) Sterilized equipment stays sterile in sealed bags until use, (2) Travel stress/logistics make daily sterilizing burdensome, (3) Short trips (3-5 days) may tolerate risk-benefit trade-off, (4) Can rinse thoroughly between treatments even if not sterilizing. Alternatives to reduce burden: disposable neb cups (still need Aerobika sterilizing), batch-sterilize multiple sets before trip. Discuss with your doctor—some may advise daily regardless, others OK with flexibility for short trips. Never skip equipment cleaning/rinsing even if postponing sterilizing."
